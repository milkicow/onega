          Moscow, loved daughter of Russia,
          Nasce una gente a cui 'l morir non dole.
          O Russia!
          O rus!
          O, never know these frightful dreams,
          Still for ever, fare thee well.

     A sorry state of things, it's true!
     A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...
     A thinker in a desert mission,

     Alone amid all his possessions,
     Along the fronts of darkened houses,

     Already borne down by regret,
     Already now the talk was thriving
     Already, in exultant fashion,
     Always our fervid hero tended

     And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
     And then she broods and mopes for good,
     And then, to part us in full measure,

     As, lovingly, in his confession,
     At feasts, though, full of pert aggression,
     At first I thought it out of season
     At first Onegin's tongue produced
     At first they called; but on perceiving
     At first, disparity of heart
     At home she'll equably receive him,
     At last he wakes, and stirs in bed,

     Bard13 of The Feasts, and heart's depression,
     Bards of our tearful generation,
     Beds are made up; the guests are all
     Believe (as conscience is my warrant),
     Below it, when sprang rains are swishing,
     Beneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,
     Between the lines of text as printed,
     Between them, every topic started
     Beyond the stream there smoked and stirred
     Blest he who in his youth was truly
     Blest he who's left the hurly-burly
     Bokharans, orchards, merchants, shacks,
     Books, riding, walks, sleep heavy-laden,
     Bordeaux, you're like a faithful friend,
     Boston and ombre for the old,
     Bubbles like Hippocrene are spraying;
     But God, how deadly dull to sample
     But I myself read my bedizened
     But come, thou youthful inspiration,
     But dinner's served, so two by two
     But don't be cross, my darling friend,
     But ever stranger and more fearful:
     But finally she heaved a yearning
     But friendship, as between our heroes,
     But from the hero of my tale,
     But go he won't: for him, a letter
     But he could draw a joking moral,
     But he's mistaken: Eugene's lying
     But he, by sad and rocky ways,
     But here, with our congratulation
     But how she jumped, when in this hovel
     But in misfortune or displeasure,
     But in that desert his attainments
     But it was passion that preempted
     But it's the talent for concealing
     But let's return to our essential,
     But my Eugene that night directed
     But not today. Although I dearly
     But now -- oh God! -- the thought of you,
     But now Aurora's crimson fingers
     But now Vladimir's doubts are still:
     But now our roads are bad, the ages
     But now the radiance of the moon
     But now they're near. Already gleaming
     But now! what brings you to my feet?
     But now, in this vindictive pleasure
     But onward, onward with my story!
     But ours, whatever he might be,
     But she refuses to perceive him,
     But she who modelled for the sketching
     But soft! You hear? A scowling critic,
     But that's enough. At once, in stead,
     But that's enough. My beauty's letter
     But the swift summer-time proceeds --
     But then, oblivious of the city,
     But to the garden, to the scene
     But was it happy, his employment,
     But what about Eugene? With reason
     But when a later age has found us,
     But when the hour of youthful passion
     But where, mid tragic storms that rend her,
     But while she roams in thought, not caring
     But who stands there, in this selected
     But you perhaps find no attraction
     But you're not sociable, they say:
     But you, blest husbands, to the end
     But you, grand tomes I loathe with passion,
     But, as it is, this pied collection
     But, did they not corrupt society,
     But, even by accident, her passion
     But, in a fearful huff, his thrifty
     But, now I've praised the queens of fashion,
     Buyánov tried -- got flea in ear.
     Buyánov whirls off Pustyakova;
     Buyánov's heels have split the wood
     Buyánov, my vivacious cousin,
     By chance those verses haven't vanished;
     By contrast, in the frozen season,
     By dire presentiment awestruck,
     By dreams now sad in their conception,
     By enemies, no less by friends
     By now the rays of spring are chasing
     By now the shades of night are flying,
     By now the sledge is at the portal --
     By now the sun is climbing steeply,
     By now whist's heroes have completed
     Can it be true, it won't come twice --
     Can she have found the enigma's setting?
     Capricious belles of grand Society!
     Chairs are pushed outward, loudly rumbling,
     Childe-Harold-like, Eugene's devoting
     Christmas came on. What joy, what gladness!
     Clarissa, Julie, or Delphine6 --
     Compassion, yes, and indignation,
     Compliment and congratulation;
     Conjecture found unending matter:
     Could it not be that by convention
     Dawn comes in mist and chill; no longer
     Day faded; on the table, glowing,
     Days when I came to flower serenely
     Deaf to her sister's intervention,
     Dear Tanya, you're condemned to perish;
     Decreed in highest court for ever...
     Deep down, an epigram is stirring
     Departure date's long overtaken;
     Deserving object: there can be
     Diana's breast, the cheeks of Flora,
     Dogs, howling, rushed in her direction...
     Don Juan's and the Giaour's creator,
     Don't let a ghost be your bear-leader,
     Down there, by slow degrees, the stream
     Dressed like -- --,14 duly dreading
     Drive on, Andryushka! quicker, quicker!
     Each day, despite the appeals of reason,
     Each one by now is badly needing
     Each others' and their own successes,
     Elated by the music's blaring,
     Elbow on table, spirit seething,
     Enchanted land! There like a lampion
     Enough I've wandered in the suite
     Enough, I tell you, that will do --
     Enough, my friends; it's all so-so.
     Enough. The load is off my shoulder!
     Escaped from social rhyme and reason,
     Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.
     Eugene attends the boulevard,
     Eugene forsakes the packed reception,
     Eugene had no wish to betray
     Eugene has caught up, quick as quick,
     Eugene takes Olga, and is gone;
     Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
     Eugene was free, and as a dresser
     Eugene would willingly have started
     Eugene's a pedant in his dress,
     Eugene's response was automatic;
     Eugene, at Olga's side, was racked
     Eugene, with solemn face, paid heed,
     Europe's most finely chiselled wares
     Even at home his occupation
     Evening, and darkening sky, and waters
     Evgeny echoed him: ``My second?
     Evgeny looks at Lensky, chilled
     Evgeny loved him from his heart,
     Evgeny quietly began
     Evgeny read the sad epistle
     Evgeny stood, with soul regretful,
     Evgeny thought in just this fashion.
     Evgeny waits: and here comes driving,
     Evgeny! ``Ah!'' Tatyana, fleeting
     Evgeny's total store of knowledge
     Evgeny, full of inward laughter,
     Evgeny, hating litigation,
     Evgeny, whom the repercussion
     Exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,
     Faces before him flash and change
     Farewell the games of golden childhood!
     Farewell to you, my free existence!
     Farewell, Petrovsky Castle, glimmer
     Farewell, familiar woods! Farewell,
     Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
     Faublas'3 disciple for an age --
     Fired by the god of inspiration,
     Five versts or so from Krasnogórie,
     Foes! Is it long since from each other
     Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
     For cousins from afar, on meeting
     For goodness' sake, you can't be serious
     For it was custom that consoled her
     For several days she peaked and pined
     For such am I. When you were speaking
     For what charade is he apparelled?
     Forsake, indulgent reader -- driven
     Freed from its dripping cork, the bottle
     Friend of my heart, be at my side,
     Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
     Friends, all this meant was: I've a date
     Friends, how my heart would leap with pleasure
     Friendship, as I must own to you,
     From all sweet things that gave me pleasure,
     From early on she loved romances,
     From here, deep-sunk in pensive woe,
     From his first youth he'd known the force,
     From hour to hour a surer capture
     From that rough spell at last exempted,
     From violent passions fast pulsating
     From widow Clicquot and from Moët,
     Full of obedience and demureness,
     Give me a pen and give me paper,
     Giving his pistol-butt a squeezing,
     God grant that from this little book
     God grant them years and years of health!
     God grant you took at least a grain.
     God's thunder burn you up! And when
     Godfearing folk will institute
     Goodbye, for now we make an end.
     Grandison, cousin, d'you remember?''
     Guillot, behind a stump in view,
     Gvozdín, Buyánov, Petushkóv
     Gvozdín, exemplary farmer,
     Happy a hundredfold, whoever
     Happy is he who's known its fretful
     He asks. She can't accept. Why ever?
     He could have spoken without harming,
     He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
     He deemed, in general, letters vain,
     He destined Olga's hand for me,
     He drained his glass down to the end
     He finds the shock beyond all bearing:
     He followed them without illusion,
     He found them in some old collection,
     He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
     He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
     He gave three balls a year, and rather
     He goes inside, corpse-like of feature...
     He got so used to this immersion,
     He lacked the slightest predilection
     He lay quite still, and strange as dreaming
     He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4
     He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
     He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;
     He opens up a door. What's that
     He reads to Olga on occasion,
     He rings at once, and what a scurry!
     He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
     He sang of grief and parting-time,
     He sang of love, to love subjected,
     He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
     He sees: in slush, stretched out and keeping
     He smiled as Lensky talked: the heady
     He sweetened up with fancy's icing
     He thought that Olga'd be confused,
     He wakes -- and who is this who writes him?
     He was a good and simple barin;6
     He was convinced, a kindred creature
     He was no fool; appreciated
     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     He was the slave of a tenacious,
     He was too young to have been blighted
     He was without that dithyrambic
     He who has lived and thought is certain
     He'd brought back all the fruits of learning
     He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
     He's always with her: either seated
     He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
     He's gone away and left his village,
     He's here -- Monsieur Guillot, my friend.
     He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
     He's off -- this ruthless legislator
     Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment,
     Her eyes along the margin flitting
     Her eyes were opened, and she said
     Her father, kindly, well-regarded,
     Her feelings in their weary session
     Her frightened cry brought running out
     Her husband enters, thus concluding
     Her loving spouse with approbation
     Her passion burns with stronger powder
     Her tender touch had never fingered
     Herder, and even at times a Russian --
     Here comes the yard-boy, who has chosen
     Here insolent prize-dandies wither
     Here stands, with shady park surrounded,
     Here with his wife, that bulging charmer,
     Here's tea: the girls have just, as bidden,
     Here, in his red peruke and glasses,
     High ceilings everywhere abounded;
     High rank, of course, and fashion's glasses,
     His father died; and (as expected)
     His father failed to understand
     His hair was fashionably curled,
     His life went sailing in calm weather;
     His unexpected apparition,
     His visitor from the beginning
     His wife, just like Tatyana, had
     Hm, hm. Distinguished reader, tell me
     Hoar-frost that crackles with a will is
     Horses and coach are spliced in marriage;
     Hours pass; no answer; waiting, waiting.
     How could she? why, he'd never heard...
     How dull are acting and evasion,
     How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
     How early on he learnt to trouble
     How fearful, in and out of season
     How heavy, and how near to sobbing,
     How long he'd been here, was her query,
     How many times I made a toy
     How oft she'd lead me, by the Tauric
     How often on the steep Caucasian
     How often would I fall to musing
     How often, when the sky was glowing,
     How often, with her sweet communion,
     How soft his glance, or at discretion
     How well he donned new shapes and sizes --
     However closely he inspected,
     However has he earned so vicious,
     Hurrah! let's start congratulating
     Hussars on leave are racing hither
     I acted thoughtlessly or not:
     I ask you, each and every poet!
     I buttonhole a wandering neighbour
     I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,
     I could describe here his attire;
     I count each hour the whole day through;
     I do, I do. Well, where's he gone?''
     I don't know why, but for my friend
     I don't mean that she never shivered,
     I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
     I drop my hero... I'll be truthful:
     I feel a brotherly affection,
     I feel a small foot in my hand;
     I find myself no longer equal;
     I find no sense; the truth is this,
     I gave my word, alas, though now
     I gave no rein to sweet affection:
     I grasp a stirrup with affection,
     I had most surely never reckoned
     I have no leisure to recall;
     I have to drag my feet to it.
     I hear the wrath of your reproach.
     I hear you say. But can you see
     I introduced my saucy Muse
     I keep them, and will quote them here:
     I kept in mind an ancient store
     I know (and seek your exculpation)
     I know it's now in your discretion
     I know it, in the thoughts of all
     I know to what malicious laughter
     I know too surely how it ends.
     I know your heart: it has a feeling
     I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
     I lack the strength required to say
     I leave the verdict in your hand.
     I like to tell the time by dinner
     I liked his quality, the dream
     I longed, like every breaker hissing,
     I love my Tatyana too much!
     I love their feet -- though I confess
     I love you (what's the use to hide
     I make magnanimous confession,
     I married. I beseech you, go;
     I meant to paint, with Alban's8 glory,
     I might have said a word, and then
     I might have seen you, heard you speak
     I move in the grand monde? that rank,
     I must translate -- there's no presuming --
     I must wake up with the conviction
     I need to rest from all this rhyme:
     I never lived or wrote for praise;
     I only write like this, you know,
     I own it: tender Parny's12 rhyme
     I pray God grant his soul salvation,
     I prize the attention of my friends,
     I put your genius to the test,
     I read with secret pain, and never
     I really dote upon the word:
     I regularly take much pleasure
     I roam by the secluded lake.
     I see another problem looming:
     I shall set out on brand-new ways
     I signal to each passing sail.
     I still find Gallicism delicious
     I suffered once from all the madness
     I thank him without reservation,
     I thought, she'll go this time, perhaps;
     I too -- when I recall Svetlana5
     I trust my fate to your direction,
     I walk the shore,17 I watch the weather,
     I was Onegin's friend that season.
     I was just thirteen years of age.
     I weep, and pray for your protection..,
     I would have chosen none but you
     I would have found a friend, another,
     I would have had the indiscretion
     I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
     I'd love you, but inside a day,
     I'd not have known you, therefore I
     I'd nothing to attract your humour...
     I'd still like dances to this day:
     I'll catalogue each simple saying
     I'll conjure up that swooning fashion
     I'll end my tale some other time.
     I'll feed the journalists for dinner
     I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
     I'll gladden your imagination,
     I'll go, I'll go!'' -- and in a stir
     I'll just remark, my verses talk
     I'll make them spar another round,
     I'll part them, bring them back together;
     I'll save this blossom on the shoot,
     I'll say: with past ideals in view
     I'll set two ages by the ears.
     I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
     I'll stop that tempter from depraving
     I'm altering my destination
     I'm at your service to protect you;
     I'm blind to every apparition;
     I'm good for nothing now, my sweet...
     I'm grateful now with all my heart.
     I'm grieving still, but no more tears,
     I'm much afraid that bilberry wine
     I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''
     I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
     I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.
     I'm terrified -- so let it be...
     I'm wandering in a world of dreams...
     I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,
     I've drawn a plan and a projection,
     I've known too many a haughty beauty,
     I've learnt new sadness; but in this
     I've learnt the voice of new ambition,
     I've no one here who comprehends me,
     I've paid my due to classic art:
     I've run a mile, I must avow,
     I've seen how, trustful in his blindness,
     I've wasted too much life away!
     Idle again by dedication,
     Idol mio or Benedetta,
     If Tanya'd had the chance of learning
     If only Lensky'd known the burning
     If suddenly aloft she spied
     Imagine it: quite on my own
     In French Onegin had perfected
     In Tanya, what a transformation!
     In backwoods, how d'you pass this season?
     In days of carefree aspirations,
     In duels a pedantic don,
     In fact one day a note came flying
     In heart's affairs, a sweet beginner,
     In languid silence, or the flame
     In love with fame, by freedom smitten,
     In passion's sluicing rain they freshen,
     In second place the poet might
     In stead of happiness, say I,
     In such an album, friends, I too
     In summertime -- for he was leading
     In swarms around Tatyana ranging,
     In the dark sky, a shooting star
     In the two sisters' rooms extended,
     In the white heat of some dissension
     In this, dear reader, if you know it,
     In time past, objects of affection
     In time, who knows, the agitation
     In winter, when for longer time
     Is Others' View,5 that clever lyric,
     Is he a Melmoth, a Childe Harold,
     Is it that we've become officious
     Is spleen his trouble, or the dumb
     Istómina,11 thronged all around
     It all seemed new -- for two days only --
     It baffles me. But I'll repeat
     It fascinates by its assurance
     It's agony to watch the hollow
     It's late. A breeze begins to roister,
     It's over. Supper is proceeding.
     It's right and proper that you went.''
     It's time she went. But what can I
     It's time to drop astern the shape
     It's time: kind-hearted, idle creatures,
     It's true, I'll not misrepresent them,
     It's true, the magnet-like attraction
     Italian nights, when I'll drink in
     Iván Petróvich still is dumb,
     Just before dinner, from his labours
     Just facing Tanya's where they're sitting;
     Just let yourself be your whole care,
     Killed!... At this frightful word a-quiver,
     Ladies came over, crossed to meet her,
     Ladies of such a cast, I think,
     Left-handed from the habitation
     Legends, and mystical traditions,
     Lel6 floats about above her head;
     Lending his tone a grave inflection,
     Lensky all evening, in distraction,
     Lensky at home awaits the answer,
     Lensky composed in autograph
     Lensky disliked the entertainments
     Lensky had a curt word to say
     Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,
     Lensky ingenuously related
     Lensky of course was quite untainted
     Lensky rejoiced. His designated
     Lensky resolved before the duel
     Lensky's estate, there lives and still
     Lensky's thrown down. The murk is thick
     Lensky, restored to his manorial
     Lensky, that tragic victim, died...
     Let me look back. Farewell, umbrageous
     Let others learn from his example!
     Let's go, our friendship's worth the labour!''
     Like convicts in a dream released
     Like modish parquetry, the river
     Like modish rhymes that lack all reason,
     Listen to me without resentment:
     Longtime inside this modish cloister,
     Lord Byron's portrait on the wall,
     Lord Byron, with his shrewd caprices,
     Lost in our backwoods habitation
     Louder and louder sounds the wrangle:
     Love passed, the Muse appeared, the weather
     Love tyrannises all the ages;
     Love's frantic torments went on beating
     Lovelace, or Grandison, or neither;
     Madame de Staël, Bichat,13 Tissot,14
     Maidservants on the beds just now
     Manzoni and Chamfort,12 perusing
     Martin Zadéka fails to mend;
     Martin Zadéka was the siren,
     Meanwhile Onegin starts to languish:
     Meanwhile another new landowner
     Meanwhile my novel's opening section
     Meanwhile the news of Eugene coming
     Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
     Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
     Melmoth,7 whose roaming never ceases,
     Melpomene wails long and loud,
     Moments of silence, quite unbroken;
     Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
     More tolerant in his conception
     More wine, he calls, to drench the flaming
     Moscow has beauties and to spare:
     Moscow's the place, the marriage-fair!
     Moscow... how many strains are fusing
     Muse of the epic, bless my work!
     Mushrooms in brine, for winter eating,
     My early bird! you know, last night
     My friends, the bard stirs your compassion:
     My goddesses! Where are you banished?
     My heart awaits you: you can turn it
     My love for it is just as tender,
     My mind is fuddled.'' ``Tell me, nyanya,
     My pen, as once, no longer hurries
     My soul's like crystal, and tomorrow

     Napoleon's our sole inspiration;

     Never come and overhear
     Next day Tatyana, early waking,
     No answer comes. Another letter
     No answer comes. He goes, for better
     No doubt about it, it's Eugene.
     No feast, no welcome-gifts -- with fire
     No hope! no hope! He leaves the revel,
     No ice and flame, no stormy weather
     No look, no word for him: she's chosen
     No madrigals were for inscribing
     No matter; fate's decree is just.
     No moralizing from this joker;
     No one will think that worth gainsaying,
     No one's, I swear by God! in sadness
     No path to see: the snow has drifted
     No secret crimes, and no perditions,
     No sleep, beneath that silken curtain,
     No tearstains, nothing. Wrath alone
     No word: another day goes by.
     No, I was born for peace abounding
     No, all in her was calm and plain.
     No, early on his heart was cooling
     No, incorrect and careless chatter,
     No, never in the hottest fire
     No, she's already pledged her word
     No, soon she changed her old demeanour:
     Noise, laughter, bowing, helter-skelter
     Not so? ``No, sirs, the ode's the thing,
     November stood outside the door.
     Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
     Now Nature's tremulous, pale effect
     Now Tanya's groaning, now she's sighing;
     Now all was still. Tatyana slept.
     Now brooding thoughts hold his attention
     Now for the first time she's escorted
     Now he's returned, what role's he dancing?
     Now hear the friends in dialogue:
     Now here's a letter, as you see,
     Now nearer... hooves... and in the yard
     Now powder's greyish stream is slipping
     Now she's alarmed; in desperate worry
     Now that the British Muse is able
     Now the mazurka sounds. Its thunder
     Now, Lensky, would it be so bad
     Now, faced with this enormous revel,
     Now, she devours, with what attention,
     Now, to my cost it may be true
     Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
     O Adrian waves, my invocation;
     O Brenta, I'll see you in dream;
     O dreams, o dreams, where is your sweetness?
     O flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,
     O spring! o time for love! how sadly
     Oak-floored, and simple as a stable:
     Of Lensky's fate they said no more --
     Of course, the love of tender beauties,
     Of course. Yet fashion's wild rotation,
     Of those who heard my opening pages
     Often of course you'll have inspected
     Often she halts against her will,
     Oh God, what did he think!'' A dream
     Oh, I've no strength... I'm tired, my chest...
     Oh, this could all be false and vain,
     Oh, when, and to what desert banished,
     Olga is there, he sees her stand
     Olga's adorer comes a-wooing.
     Olga's appeared upon the scene,
     Olga's no life in her regard:
     Olinka and her mother sent:
     Olinka yawned, just like her neighbour,
     Omens dismayed her with their presage;
     On an old aunt, who's long been burning
     On such indifference, such forgetting
     On the first sheet you'll find a question:
     On the seashore, with storm impending,
     On these, with something like obsession,
     On this we'll part; goodbye again!
     On whom alone can we depend?
     Once Vyázemsky,4 who chanced to find her
     Once home, he brought out and inspected
     Once more he counts the hour-bells tolling,
     Once more he turned to books, unchoosing,
     One melancholy fop, declaring
     Onegin -- now once more my theme --
     Onegin comes, and makes excuses;
     Onegin had no word to say;
     Onegin has outrun us all.
     Onegin knew enough to savour
     Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
     Onegin sits at table too,
     Onegin spoke about its flights
     Onegin still is slumbering deeply.
     Onegin swiftly came to know
     Onegin too -- and there to see,
     Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''
     Onegin turns, and with a shiver
     Onegin was assessed by many
     Onegin wastes, you'd almost find
     Onegin without more ado
     Onegin's life, you see, was holy;
     Onegin's soul encountered there
     Onegin's waiting on the ground.''
     Onegin, d'you recall the day
     Onegin, drenched with sudden chill,
     Onegin, my good friend, was littered
     Only Tatyana does not sleep,
     Only from Tanya's heart, no cheering --
     Only the estate provides a setting
     Only the ode, that solemn story!
     Or from all notion of enjoyment
     Or he knew how to reconcile them
     Or, as by Lethe's bank he slumbered,
     Or, in your lonely homestead, moping,
     Or, unconsoled by the returning
     Our evanescent northern summer
     Our love is what they most abhor;
     Outside the gate Tatyana parted
     Parisian taste invents for one --
     Perhaps however, to be truthful,
     Perhaps some secret apprehension
     Perhaps to improve the world's condition,
     Perhaps, when thoughts are all a-quiver
     Petrovsky Castle; and the fame
     Petushkóv, local Paris, tearing,
     Pikhtín, of the Hussars, was here;
     Pistols are out, they gleam, the hammer
     Pleasant, in spite of its compression,
     Please follow me. And here's the inner
     Poets, I'll say in this connection,
     Poor Lensky! Set aside for weeping,
     Poor Lensky! where the tomb is bounded
     Poor Tanya's bloom begins to languish,
     Porcelain and bronzes on the table,
     Praskovya re-baptized ``Polina'';
     Prepared for prophecy and fable,
     Present me, please.'' ``You're joking.'' ``Never.''
     Presently Olga's ringing answer
     Priam-like agricultural sages,
     Prince N. respectfully invites him
     Princess Alina. She was still
     Protect me from such apparition
     Proud Albion's lyre is what I follow,
     Public opinion -- here's our idol,
     Rage died, and jealousy's obsession,
     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     Reader, the elder sister now
     Reader, whatever fate's direction,
     Reflection was her friend and pleasure
     Relations. No-one else at all.
     Remember the retort satiric!
     Revenge's hour is near, and after
     Riding on the lugubrious prairie?
     Right at the outset of my story
     Risen with earliest rays of dawning,
     Rousseau (forgive a short distraction)
     Russia's Terpsichore, shall never
     Russia's old glories and their gleams,
     Russian pancakes were always served;
     Saint Petersburg's fine flower was there --
     Sbogar,8 mysterious through and through,
     Schiller and Goethe had refined him,
     Searching the table exegetic
     Seeing Vladimir had defected,
     Seeing herself as a creation --
     Semyón Petróvich, mean and glum,
     Shade-like, in purposeless obsession
     Shall I depict with expert knowledge
     She dreamt of portents. In her dreaming
     She dropped... ``It's he! Eugene arriving!
     She enjoys the stately orchestration
     She entered the deserted yard.
     She faced him, questioning: ``But you?...''
     She folds the page, lays down the plume.,
     She hates a friendly voice's sound,
     She hesitates, and doubts beset her:
     She looked across, felt in her heart
     She looks: forgotten past all chalking
     She loved the balcony, the session
     She sits down by the window-sill.
     She sits with Nina8 at a table --
     She struck one as the incarnation --
     She wanders on without direction.
     She was alone, lit by the moon.
     She was like him and always sported
     She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
     She'll not see him, her obligation
     She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
     She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
     She's fallen in the snow -- alertly
     She's here, she spreads abroad; she stipples
     She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.
     She's paid the sunrise no attention,
     Shishkov,6 forgive me: I don't know
     Shot through below the chest -- and streaming
     Should your perfections be expended
     Shy as a savage, silent, tearful,
     Sign of the urge for domination:
     Silence was everywhere enthralling;
     Since dawn, whole families have been driving
     Since earliest boyhood he had doted
     Since then Martin Zadéka's spell
     Since when is this?'' ``Two years or more.''
     Smiling through sleep, nature is meeting
     So Lensky wrote, obscurely, limply
     So a disabled soldier-man,
     So down came Tanya, hardly daring
     So glut yourselves until you're sated
     So let me with a kind expression
     So my Zaretsky, as I said,
     So now be off to Neva's brink,
     So she was called Tatyana. Truly
     So the poor butterfly will quiver
     So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
     So to his wife for presentation
     So went his sermon. Almost dying,
     So you, inspired Yazýkov,4 sobbing
     So, like Childe Harold, glum, unpleasing,
     So, verse and prose, they came together.
     Softly the door is opened, enter
     Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
     Some neighbours there have come together;
     Sometimes a landscape's represented,
     Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble,
     Spoilt by the habit of indulgence,
     Still as he was? has he stopped prancing?
     Still blazing with resentment's fuel,
     Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
     Still on the board, the beakers hissed,
     Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
     Straight up the chimney, pipes were smoking.
     Street lamps go flashing by, and stalls,
     Strike the ditty up, my sweets,
     Such feckless passion -- as I live,
     Such were a young rake's meditations --
     Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted
     Sunk in dejection, she won't hear
     Take Olga's shoulders now -- the beauty!
     Tanya (profoundly Russian being,
     Tanya begins to understand
     Tanya comes to in utter fright...
     Tanya is gripped. No comment's made
     Tanya looks on; her own indictment
     Tanya pursued them with her gaze...
     Tanya thanks each one with a phrase.
     Tanya to all her kin. My sorrow
     Tanya today goes hurrying out
     Tanya's distress had risked detection
     Tanya's no longer quite so frightened
     Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.
     Tatyana asked. The children all
     Tatyana breathed on the cold pane,
     Tatyana dear, with you I'm weeping:
     Tatyana flushed, and started shaking.
     Tatyana groaned above the tide;
     Tatyana had a changeling look
     Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
     Tatyana heard Evgeny out.
     Tatyana hears but takes no part;
     Tatyana in a deep emotion
     Tatyana in low-cut attire
     Tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling,
     Tatyana listened with vexation
     Tatyana looks with pulses racing
     Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:
     Tatyana lowered her regard
     Tatyana never knew the attraction
     Tatyana now need wait no longer.
     Tatyana on; Miss Kharlikova,
     Tatyana pined in secret fashion:
     Tatyana seeks to attune her ear,
     Tatyana sees with trepidation
     Tatyana shared with full conviction
     Tatyana simply lay in bed,
     Tatyana struggles to run out --
     Tatyana turned with thirsting soul:
     Tatyana watched the moon, and floated
     Tatyana went with them, and sped
     Tatyana! it's addressed... to whom?
     Tatyana'd rise by candlelight.
     Tatyana's haunted by her vision,
     Tatyana's heart is rent in two.
     Tatyana's here, you know I've brought her...''
     Tatyana's husband, now appearing...
     Tatyana's letter, treasured ever
     Tatyana's love is no by-play,
     Tatyana's name day celebration.
     Tatyana's rites are not for me.
     Tatyana, hiding her condition,
     Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
     Tatyana, lonely heroine,
     Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,
     Tatyana3 was her name... I own it,
     Thank you for all the gifts I treasure,
     That isn't our immediate worry:
     That point I wouldn't mind contesting,
     That year the season was belated
     That's when I'll sit down to compose
     The Larins kept the old tradition:
     The World found this enough to treat
     The arbitrary rules of passion
     The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
     The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,
     The bearded outrider is sitting
     The better to dispel her sorrow
     The bitterness was mine -- the ice
     The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
     The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
     The château was of a construction
     The choirs of dancers sought their quarters.
     The city's early sounds awake her;
     The clock of doom had struck as fated;
     The comrade of so many days,
     The crush, the heat, as music blares,
     The darkness thins away; but still
     The days flew past; by now the season
     The evening passes, and meanwhile
     The fields are dark, since evening came.
     The fire was dying; cinders faintly
     The flirt has reason's cool volition;
     The hall is full of noise and hustle,
     The happiness of youth is dead,
     The hearth was low beyond all stoking.
     The horses, as they sense the dead,
     The house is packed out; scintillating,
     The illness with which he'd been smitten
     The invalid's glad salutation,
     The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
     The kinsfolk in concerted action
     The lady of the house has fled.
     The manor house, in deep seclusion,
     The nervous-tragical reaction,
     The night has many stars that glitter,
     The north wind blows, the clouds are driving --
     The old dame had no thought of scouring
     The olden days, I want to hear...''
     The place where Eugene loathed his leisure
     The ploughman there delights to doze,
     The poet's dead... already though
     The princess, sitting peaked and wan,
     The protocol is all one wishes:
     The rustic sage, in that apartment,
     The sky breathed autumn, time was flowing,
     The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;
     The storm is over,5 dawn is paling,
     The tomcat, mannered and affected,
     The two old ladies kiss and cry;
     The vote was passed without demur.
     The world of fashion, prone to flatter,
     The yard was bursting with dependants;
     The years incline to gloom and prosing,
     The years would pass; no longer youthful,
     Their look, though, shows no change upon it --
     Their talk, so sound on every matter,
     Then Tanya hears of the decision.
     Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,
     Then gradually upon sensation,
     Then in return for all this twaddle,
     Then our Automedons are flashing,
     Then verdicts from her husband's quartet
     Then what resulted from the meeting?
     Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
     Then, after midday he'll be waking;
     Then, crying, they untwined my plait,
     Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
     There came a murmur, for a fleeting
     There many pages keep the impression
     There once I too strolled back and forth:
     There sings the nightingale, spring's lover,
     There too, he honoured, hotly weeping,
     There was -- --,10 so notorious
     There was a period when cold-blooded
     There was a pine-branch downward straying
     There you're entirely sure of finding
     There's din of parting now that rages,
     There's powdery snow up to her knees;
     There's vacancies in plenty there.''
     There, with epigrammatic neatness,
     These days I'm finding even gladness,
     These figures from the world of seeming,
     They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --
     They laugh. The guests begin arriving.
     They should be forced to read in Russian,
     They sing; unmoved by their sweet-sounding
     They take her too to the Assembly.
     They will receive us with delight.''
     They're settled in; and crawling, sliding,
     They've missed Eugene's completed etching.
     This dear, still world I must forswear
     This wearisome perambulation
     This work of the profoundest learning
     This world's so vacuous that it's got
     Those friends, those friends! it is, I fear,
     Though belles had lost his adoration,
     Though long since Eugene's disapproval
     Three whole hours, at the least accounting,
     Thronged by adorers, I've detected
     Through the tight ranks -- aristocratic,
     Throughout their life, so calm, so peaceful,
     Time races, and she's been forgetting
     Time was, he'd been the wittiest ever,
     To batten down their indignation
     To be a butt for the malicious
     To face society's derision
     To harmless idleness devoted,
     To me, unsmiling lips bring terror,
     To my astonishment I've seen her,
     To private tastes we each subscribe:
     To reading from this odd collection
     To talk, to general conversation
     To whom do you, from all the train
     Today a mental fog enwraps us,
     Today it's turn and turn about.
     Today... the sad memorial's lonely,
     Triquet sings, out of tune. Loud clapping
     Triquet, ingenious poet, dares
     True, scorn should punish and should bridle
     Tsimlyansky wine, between the meat
     Two hearts there are perhaps that keep
     Two weeks the matchmaker was plying
     Uncle, in bed, and near to dying,
     Unforced, as conversation passed,
     Up to the porch our hero's driven:
     Vesper is met by crow of cock --
     Vladimir Lensky, whose creator
     Vladimir Lensky. Quick, let's dine!
     Vladimir drops, hand softly sliding
     Vladimir shuts the book, for writing
     Vladimir to this casual mention
     Vladimir's challenge found expression
     Vladimir, wealthy and good-looking,
     Walking her horse in introspection
     Walking? The country that you roam
     Was it for you that I became
     Was it not in such sweet employment
     Was it to no effect that he,
     Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
     We all meandered through our schooling
     We all resemble more or less
     We each enjoy a special hobby,
     We each have enemies in this world,
     We must confess that taste deserts us
     We too shall find our hour is waiting;
     We've many neighbours round about;
     Well, I must make a frank confession,
     Weltered in tears, and sorely smarting,
     What ails him? he's in some strange daze!
     What breasts! What soul!... We'll go one day
     What cause has won me your attention?
     What do I want? what am I after,
     What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,
     What fate is my tomorrow brewing?
     What folly! and what retribution!
     What happened? Though his eyes were reading,
     What if your pistol-shot has smitten
     What of it? Nothing. I'm just sending
     What of it? it's euphonious, pleasant,
     What power enslaves you, with your seeming
     What scorn I see in the expression
     What sort of roses, in your notion,
     What trifling could be more complete?
     What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
     Whatever for caprice of spending
     Whatever in this rough confection
     When Eugene's turn for salutation
     When I defected from their union
     When comes my moment to untether?
     When out to burst a rival's bubble,
     When progress and amelioration
     When we draw a fellow in,
     When we've retreated to the banner
     Whenever nyanya had collected
     Where are you? come -- and my own right
     Where is the fire that once ignited,
     Where to, God knows. The trail is dead.
     Whether the arrow has my number,
     Which one comes first? It's just the same
     While Lensky'd long been meditating
     While under the connubial banner
     Who could have looked the poet better,
     Who in that flash could not have reckoned
     Who in the princess for that second
     Who is there who will truly measure
     Who on earth is he? not... our hero?
     Who taught her all this mad, slapdash,
     Who taught her an address so tender,
     Who'll never fault our vices, or
     Who'll sow no calumnies around us?
     Who's not disgusted by cajoling,
     Whom then to credit? Whom to treasure?
     Whose fond attentions will astound us?
     Why have you gone all pale and queasy?''
     Why is Tatyana guiltier-seeming?
     Why then do you pursue me now?
     Why, pretty one, you're up already!
     Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
     Winter!... The countryman, enchanted,
     With a sharp epigram it's pleasant
     With mounts from home, or postal station,
     With reason, too: for when he'd vetted
     With spelling scrambled to perdition,
     With that, in tears, and quite worn out,
     With womankind, the less we love them,
     Without romance, or false insistence,
     Worse luck, Larina crawled; the employment
     Yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,
     Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,
     Yet -- fear itself she found presented
     Yet Tanya's note made its impression
     Yet hissing froth deals a malicious,
     Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
     Yet sweeter far, at such a time,
     Yet the mazurka keeps today
     You husbands, deeply I respect you!
     You too, mamas, I pray attend it,
     You too, prime beauties in your flower
     You'd never class her as a beauty;
     You'll love again, but you must teach
     You've guessed before it all began:
     Young ladies jump for future blisses...
     Your curiosity is burning
     Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,
     Zarétsky, sometime king of brawls
     Zaretsky bit his lip. Eugene
     Zaretsky draws up a convention
     Zaretsky rose without discussion;
     Zaretsky watched, and stood there grinning.
     Zaretsky, engineer-in-waiting,
     Zizi, my crystal and my gem,
     ``A humble sinner, Dimitry Larin,
     ``Abandon hope for evermore.''9
     ``Ah, Tanya, come to me, it seems
     ``Akulka'' the onetime Selina,
     ``All right, I'll come then...'' ``What a friend!''
     ``And here's the hearth,'' explains the crone,
     ``Another!... No, another never
     ``As for the other one... tomorrow
     ``At the Larins'!'' ``But how mysterious.
     ``Bliss was so near, so altogether
     ``Boredom, that's what so bad, my friend.''
     ``But I was simply not intended
     ``But I'm denied this: all for you
     ``But so it is: I'm in no state
     ``But tell me who she is.'' ``My wife.''
     ``But tell me, which one was Tatyana?''
     ``But there'll be such a rout and scrabble
     ``But, if you've kept some faint impression
     ``By virtue of procrastinating
     ``Can it be she?'' Eugene in wonder
     ``Come to me in my golden halls.''
     ``Command me, darling, as you choose.''
     ``Could I be happy circumscribing
     ``Could I just see the house, I wonder?''
     ``Enough, stand up. It's now for me
     ``Farewell, you realms that own the sway
     ``For then, Onegin, I was younger,
     ``Get up, my child, it's time, get up!
     ``Get up: it's gone six! I'll be bound,
     ``Gladly.'' ``So when?'' ``Why not tonight?
     ``Go, nurse, and leave me here apart.
     ``Goodbye, Onegin, time I went.''
     ``Here in the winter he'd have dinner
     ``Here, near Saint Simeon; in December,
     ``How Tanya's grown! I pulled your ear
     ``How did you come to marry, nyanya?''
     ``How long can you... ?'' ``Dearest kuzina!''
     ``How long has he been on the scene?
     ``How slow you are at guessing, nyanya!''
     ``I am in love,'' Tatyana's wailing
     ``I am in love; leave me alone.''
     ``I can't sleep, nyanya: it's so stifling!
     ``I close. I dread to read this page...
     ``I don't see what's so bad about it.''

     a Russian family's old traditions;
     a Russian hammer-blow, repairs
     a ball here, there a children's party;
     a ball in Petersburg; but fun
     a bit provincial and affected,
     a blank default would suit me better.
     a blessing from its blasts and rages,
     a block of snow will slip and tumble.
     a book of household calculations,
     a brook flows through a grove of lime.
     a calculation past despising --
     a carving-knife -- and in the tangle
     a cheerful glimmer on the snow
     a classicist, he'll not allow
     a corpse on boards was all he found,
     a country house -- and one who still
     a crayfish rides on spider-back;
     a deathless murmur from within,
     a deft arrangement to his hair,
     a different mask? is he becoming
     a dog with horns, a goatee'd witch,
     a dream's mute monument, reflection
     a dumb moon, on a dumb horizon.''
     a dwarf with tail, and a half-strain,
     a far-flung traveller who was creaking
     a fashion-plate for illustrators,
     a faster, stronger pulsing start.
     a few books had escaped disgrace:
     a fisher's fire. Through country gleaming
     a flimsy bridge whose every quake
     a flood on which no frosty band
     a foe -- our mood should be warm-hearted.
     a fop, a punter on the cards,
     a free romance's far horizon,
     a frequent question: ``tell me who
     a friend of yours in his first youth
     a full confession of the heart.
     a furious, boiling, heaving main
     a general of majestic bearing
     a girl or two, without a smile
     a glossary of smart argot...
     a grain of gladness; tears' repression
     a grammar, a digest of fable,
     a great attraction to conversing.
     a grey-haired, perfumed exquisite,
     a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them,
     a group of monsters round a table,
     a gulf has gaped... Says Tanya: ``I
     a haze in me, but I grew used
     a hermit's life -- he'd be proceeding
     a hidden beauty in the end:
     a hideous deal of tribulation.
     a house, a village, and a wood
     a humble cross, in woodland gloom,
     a hundred times afresh distorted;
     a hybrid cross of cat and crane.
     a joker in the old tradition,
     a joking flirt, or both together,
     a lady -- what a grim discussion! --
     a liar still, Lyubóv Petrovna,
     a life-creating voice was lost;
     a lyre, and on it perched, a dove --
     a madrigal for epitaph.
     a mansion stands just round a turning.
     a marksman crouching in the green.
     a masculine disguise to aid
     a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
     a modish second-hand edition,
     a modish taste, a dowdy touch --
     a monster of the gens Satanic,
     a nation's wealth is, what augments it,
     a nightingale, in forest gloom,
     a note from Lensky; in between
     a novel graced with such a name.
     a novel in Lafontaine's8 manner...
     a novel on the established line
     a novel, vague and superficial,
     a park, enormous and neglected,
     a parodistic raree-show?
     a passer-by; and on tiptoe
     a patriot, a cosmopolite,
     a place for rest. Eugene alone
     a plain, unceremonious troop,
     a poet, and a Kantian sage.
     a portrait with a charming touch;
     a pretty girl exactly like
     a quilted chamber-robe and cap.
     a raging torrent, capped with breakers,
     a rambling walk beside my lake,
     a red-foot goose, weight something fearful,
     a rest from toil and all its aches,
     a restless urge for change of place
     a riding whip. Tanya keeps walking...
     a rogue, a slanderer, a poltroon,
     a rooster head, and on the twitch
     a saucy kibítka is slicing
     a scream rings out... the cabin's quaking...
     a secret truth, and at our cost
     a seedling fallen in the earth.
     a shadow, null and meaningless,
     a sham that trustful souls work out;
     a shambling hoof along the way;
     a sharp-nailed paw towards her; bracing
     a simple Russian family night:
     a simple monument is built.
     a single thing to her. His head
     a skeleton jerked by a cable,
     a slipper, or a magazine?
     a soul of sympathy and grace,
     a soul so innocent, so trusting.
     a soul that nothing can renew...
     a soul that perished long ago,
     a spirit strange, a spirit burning,
     a stall, a kitchen and a fence.
     a stanza villainously padded.
     a steed responsive to the bridle,
     a story that still wants completing;
     a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed
     a suite of elegies that, throbbing,
     a swift, polite reply is written.
     a tear for him... but what's to weep?
     a tempting plume for you to take?
     a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,
     a treasure never to be shared.
     a true companion to the end,
     a truly noble disposition;
     a vivid brush, a witty rattle --
     a vulgar touch. I can't translate.
     a wondrous tenderness. And whether
     a word or two, or stare unseeing,
     a young girl's looking-glass is kept.
     about one thing, till our next meeting.
     about them -- nineteen to the dozen --
     about what's buried in the past:
     above a stream the moon had lighted.
     above the dust of his remains
     above the water started tracing
     absorbed me in the recollection
     accounts were done, a winter outing
     accounts, shaved forelocks,4 Sunday bath;
     across each bush, across each steep,
     across green meadows, dilly-dally,
     across our snows of northern bleakness
     across the Baltic in exchange
     across the drift-encumbered acres,
     across the fields, round hill and rock;
     across the plain's enormous room,
     across the public's toes; he steers
     across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --
     across the years to our own time.
     across to her consort a weary
     active, and hopeful, and insistent:
     acute and subtle -- in a word

     affected pose -- and an unspeaking
     after Saint Chariton's gone past
     after her own room, makes her fret.
     after that, supper's served, and so
     after the martyr's price it paid,
     after two minutes, off again,
     after your drive, it's quite back-breaking;
     again I see your soulful flight?
     against each other swift, small feet.
     against the tea's excessive sweetness,
     aged Derzhávin1 saw and blessed us
     ages we'd never heard of love:
     alarmed by my melodious lay,
     album and stays, Princess Alina,
     all a pure maiden's love was breathing.
     all blend into Eugene alone.
     all brought to life at your direction.
     all day, all night, his presence fills her,
     all egoistical and dry,
     all for our tender dreamy maiden
     all in a blaze, I said: it's he!
     all modish foes dread worldly shame.
     all of an emptiness so killing -- >
     all others with a waistcoat's set
     all plunged his soul deep in the stream
     all point at her, and all combine
     all shout and argue, laugh and squeak.
     all sorts of hopeless appetites;
     all stand. He walks towards the door.
     all that today we find absurd.
     all these are charming! but to put
     all this, at eighteen years of age,
     all was material for transcribing:
     all's well; the destined hour at last
     allow no rest to you or me;
     allows her hand, that's lost all feeling,
     allows no comfort to come through --
     almanacs, journals of reflection,
     almost as good as a dim lamp.
     alone across the fields of space,
     alone with him; Onegin takes her
     alone, and sunk in calculation,
     alone, with no adornment on;
     along Tverskaya Street already
     along the Neva in a sleigh,
     along the street lies dirty snow;
     along the street where slumber drowses,
     already high in treason's league!
     already she'd assume ill-luck.
     already silvering all the plain...
     already stirred him as they should.
     already studying to intrigue,
     already tends too much to smile
     already there she stands beside him;
     already yawned before the show,
     although it's nearly heard the knell,
     although one in no manner shares
     although there are no streets, no cards,
     always before the volume ended
     always comes back: I'll not be wedded.
     always contented with his life,
     always monotonously gay,
     am I estranged, does all that cheers,
     am always glad to write, it's true,
     am doomed to perish, yet to die
     amateur of caprice and quirk.
     amazement: ``Where's your second gone?''
     ambassador?'' In some surprise
     amid the deadening joys of fashion,
     amidst the howling and the blast
     among my friends, in all that crowd
     among the guests a general dinning:
     among the guests she recognized
     among the maidens and the wives,
     among the neighbours round about.
     amongst devout coquettes, appalling
     amongst the crafty and small-minded,
     amusing, flattering with the best,
     an ace a dozen yards away;
     an album's loose and floating sheaves.
     an elegy to her address,
     an eloquence of fevered strength,
     an idle monk in glum seclusion,
     an inn at each stage of the route.
     an ode in twenty-five cantos.
     an offering ready for the ground.
     an old man saw her as she came,
     an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,
     ancestral1 portraits met the view
     and Dunya works the samovar;
     and Flyánov, amply lubricated,
     and Grandison beyond compare,
     and I be by the world forgot;
     and I surrender to my fate.''
     and I'll be thirty in a trice?
     and I'll be true to him, for life.''
     and Lensky follows her... Eugene,
     and Lensky, left eye closing, aimed --
     and Malek Adel,4 de Linar,5
     and Paris too. But hear my pleading:
     and Werther, martyred and doom-laden,
     and ``what's your name?'' she asks him, speaking
     and act the humble or imperious,
     and after jealousy's grim weather
     and all into the salon squeeze,
     and all is lost beyond retrieving;
     and all our fresh imagination,
     and all our modish education;
     and all the neighbours planned a match
     and all the works of Fontanelle16 --
     and all the world is buried deep.
     and all their ravishing invention
     and all this flashy masquerading,
     and almost swoons, and almost dies.
     and also prettier, I'll be bound,
     and although Troy's greybeards, collected
     and always the inspired regard --
     and always the self-same objection;
     and an insouciant lorgnette.
     and ananas, the gold of trees.
     and arm in arm they all go through;
     and as in some appalling dream
     and at the altar, with a crown,
     and at the very self-same time
     and autumn lingered, long and slow;

     and crisply crunch the morning snow.
     and daily scenes of modish life
     and dead ideas from that old hoard,
     and dinner with a touch of idle
     and doctors, he'd have died in bed.

     and every plea that lips can treat;

     and everything is cramped and loud;
     and exclamations, and good cheer.
     and faithful wife I'd have been cast.

     and hid the bookshelf's dusty stack
     and hills that delicately winter
     and home he drives, deep-sunk in thought.
     and hope and passion; life had glowed
     and how a country lives, and why

     and in the misted condensation

     and part in kindness? Just the same,
     and parted from her by their star.
     and parts the fringes of his curtain;
     and pay my debt in the same coin
     and plaits a piebald shoe of bast;
     and pledged to you, and firmly planned:
     and plunged in tender shame's confusion,
     and portents of the lunar phase.
     and prone to censure in our thought;
     and put a cross-sign on the maid.
     and put his glasses on to see
     and put our heart into a shiver
     and put them on a paced-out site.

     and records of a heart in pain.
     and redcurrants throw at him.
     and rest his dear bones in the tomb,
     and rest myself from earlier days.
     and riches, and the wish to thank
     and rightly so, but now his pain

     and ruled him like an autocrat --

     and sat there as the minutes crept;
     and satisfied with what he'd got,
     and saved from being charmed or fooled!
     and says: ``Farewell, you vales and fountains!

     and sees... whatever do you think?
     and self-oblivion was his art!
     and set off prompter than a whistle
     and set on hating the coquette,
     and sets her gently on the floor.
     and she, submissively, inertly --
     and should have played a different part:
     and shout, and make room for the pair.
     and shouts suggest a crowded wake;
     and sideways her poor head is stooping.
     and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
     and silently he hung his head.
     and sink to prose's humble level:
     and skids and tumbles down; the cheerful
     and sleeping sounder than a rock.
     and slowly day begins to climb.

     and so in the salons could make
     and so in winter-fields will shiver

     and some were even testifying
     and soon his travels had begun,
     and soon they bring her... a guitar
     and soon will day's bright tune be played;
     and soon, oh soon the storm's arrears
     and stately periwigs, their fame.
     and still exempted from removal
     and still within, behind the veil
     and stops his doleful heart from sleeping:
     and stoves with tiles of various hue.
     and strip the forest round about.
     and swaggers in a red calpack;
     and swarming in his inmost soul.
     and take due warning from my speech.
     and taken by the French -- some prize! --
     and tea and supper; there's an inner
     and tea's brought in. Instead of chimes
     and teaching children how to spell.
     and tears were drowning her regard.
     and tedious means to festive ends.
     and tell of children's plighted playing
     and telling trochee from iambic
     and than these letters, and these tears.
     and that embittered mind which boils
     and the Skotínins, grizzled sages,
     and the blancmanger, then a fleet
     and the churchyard where, new-erected,
     and the deep-throated billows' choric

     and then a drozhky's clopping sound
     and then a stroll in Letny Park.

     and then it's tea that comes to mention,
     and then old cousin Pelagéya
     and then sat silent all the way.
     and then, indoors the livelong day,
     and then, with an enchanting grace,
     and there a tombstone says its word
     and there at large he goes patrolling
     and there, beneath your noonday sky,
     and there, love's protestations, binding
     and those we sing for will be paid

     and though my muse may be capricious,
     and though perhaps old fires were thrusting
     and though to do so would be daring,
     and thought, a sleepy numbness steals;
     and thoughts of her were what inspired him
     and thus our race, so fluctuating,

     and washed its face, to her brought word
     and wasted life's fine flower meanwhile.
     and watch him stubbornly bring low
     and watch your daughters closer yet,
     and watched a different world unroll.

     and where most surely notes are sped.
     and where the husband, recognizing
     and where's her sister now? and where,

     and with his dinner, and his wife.
     and with its feeble glow outlining
     and with no post, no work, no wife,
     and with the decorous throng to follow
     and wore his dressing-gown to dine.

     as battles go, I've not begun;
     as bonneted Academician
     as by the shortest way they flew,
     as did the general at her side.
     as fast as post-horses could go,
     as fate's mysterious purpose burrows,
     as files, and scissors straight and curving,

     as horses whirled him through the dust.
     as if a cold hand squeezed her heart,
     as if beneath her, dark and rumbling,
     as if she'd been profoundly sleeping,
     as if some goal had been achieved.

     as pair by pair the dancers fly.
     as sacred, lies before me still.
     as scarlet heels have lost their name
     as smoke in azure sky disperses.
     as something not to be declared,
     as the perfection of our days!

     at hours, which, why I cannot think,
     at last alone, and quite forgetting

     at once they give a man the spleen.
     at soldier-husbands, and the drum.

     at such vivacious, free good sense.
     at sunken wax inside a bowl:

     before a cold, indifferent crowd,
     before a fire too slowly flaming,
     before first light they have appointment,
     before him roast beef, red and gory,
     before his eyes, imagination
     before it was the golden play
     before my gaze began to pass.
     before she goes, she seeks permission
     before such candour of expression,
     before such playfulness of soul!...
     before the clavichord with knitted
     before the fire a table's spread;
     before the window taking station,

     had long been wasting and enslaved
     had long proved tedious to distraction:
     had made his name, when, bold as bold,
     had nothing to employ his life.

     had only debts on which to live.
     had ruled out reading, in their place

     has lately wintered, just a space
     has left, and no one here has met her...
     has made the park her brooding-place,
     has never staked his family seat.

     has painted for us the first snow
     has something low and unrefined.

     have reunited friend to friend!

     having decyphered on their brow

     he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,
     he carries her inside the door
     he changed the corvée of tradition
     he charged three roubles and a half,
     he consecrated to my keeping?...
     he danced attendance with the best;
     he doesn't hear when I address

     he drinks -- all shout and take a swill;
     he drives in brilliant sun; striated
     he drives there like a bird in flight,
     he drives up in and out of season
     he ended even your employment;
     he even dares, once in a while,
     he eyes the door, looks slyly through.
     he failed to join that sharp profession
     he fed on hope's deceptive dinner;
     he fell in love with darkest wildwood,
     he fled from their resounding chatter!
     he found Tatyana so attractive,
     he found all kinds of brickbat hurled.
     he found too much that he regretted:
     he gazed out on the threatening glow.
     he goes ahead and parts the motley
     he had conveyed some moral teaching,
     he had the talent of saluting
     he has to bring the battle-case.
     he heard in stillness and in din
     he hears a voice; ``well, what? he's killed!''
     he informed this envoy diplomatic
     he killed eight years in such a style,
     he knew too well that sort of scene.
     he laughs -- they all begin to chuckle;
     he leaves a tender verse behind,
     he leaves one morning the hermetic
     he leaves the house, calls for his horse
     he looks, and sees the hour of day --
     he looks, in sweet irresolution,
     he loves you... like your kith and kin!
     he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
     he never took one from the shelf,
     he reached the stream below the hill;
     he read of course the sceptic Bayle15
     he read, and read -- no satisfaction:
     he really forced one to admire him --
     he rested -- wept for by his neighbours,
     he sang of lifetime's yellowed page --
     he saw no point in staying on,
     he saw that, as in cities, here
     he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;
     he sends a letter, penned with passion.
     he sends, a second, then a third.
     he should have settled for disarming
     he sleeps, away from glare and glamour,
     he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,
     he stalked the drawing-rooms, remote
     he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
     he stood there, pensive and forgetful,
     he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
     he strove to achieve the appropriation
     he struggled to bite back the chilling
     he takes her to a chair, beginning
     he trembles, knows not what to tell;
     he turns away: ``I've had enough --
     he wakes; a bath where ice is floating;
     he warns his man for duty, stressing
     he was a menace, and a freak.
     he was a poet in his day.
     he watched the guests and, as he dined,
     he whirls her through the wood... a hovel
     he who has cooled down love with parting,
     he would have found a normal fate.
     he'd drink his coffee, flutter through
     he'd got annoyed, the tricky devil.
     he'd listen to the administrator;
     he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
     he'd sack the Muses and get wedded;
     he'd see his soul cool in its grate;
     he'd swim this Hellespont; then later
     he'll charm you with his fine invention,
     he'll spend before the looking-glass,
     he'll take you prisoner, you'll admire
     he's a freemason too; for him,
     he's at the club, a real stayer,
     he's bowed politely; his attention
     he's called you out -- say, in your soul
     he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
     he's first to toast her in the bowl,
     he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
     he's got consumption. In his anguish
     he's happy, yes, he's almost well...
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     he's left sad footprints on the ground.
     he's lost his self-command, and crazed
     he's moved... you see him from the side.''
     he's put belle Tatiana instead.
     he's racing millward like a bird.
     he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
     he's up the steps, with heart a-quiver
     he's viewed the boxes without passion,

     heartfelt, imploring, touching trash

     her bosom heaves, her cheeks are staring
     her bow, as calm and as restrained.

     her discomposure, her confusion,
     her drops of tears, and seated there,
     her eyes are lowered, but ablaze,
     her face would pale, she'd start to quiver.
     her feelings were far more inclined --
     her fingers shake, she doesn't dare
     her full account of voiceless pain?
     her girlhood games; in them he'd shared,
     her golden earrings off and whipping;
     her grief, and nearly ran away.
     her handkerchief has fallen too;
     her hands affectionately pressed;
     her head in modesty cast down,
     her heart had long been overrun:
     her heart had spoken, free as air,
     her heart speaks to her even louder

     her out-of-fashion turns of phrase,
     her path a hare in headlong flight
     her progress at the masquerade.
     her sacred store of bliss and weeping
     her seal with its engraven crest.
     her secret work of magic suasion!
     her soul was waiting... for someone.

     his hours to dreaming them away:
     his housekeeper and her department
     his humbly suppliant approach,
     his illness lends him courage and
     his itching verse, Monsieur Triquet
     his life till dawn's already making,
     his lyre, now stilled, in its high mission
     his mind's eye focused on the hinted
     his mind, in judgement still unsteady,
     his mind, so cold and so precise.
     his mother taps the window-pane.

     how are your kith and kin today?
     how bold or bashful there, and here
     how brilliant with its instant tear!
     how dull to work for the correction
     how envious was I of the waves
     how fearful, too, is my obsession
     how long is it?'' ``And since I fed
     how many follies were engendered;
     how many lines of verse, and themes
     how pleasantly the stages pass.
     how proudly, how divinely gleaming,
     how sad the scar of passion's knife:
     how sensuously her eyes are dreaming!
     how soon the bounds of rank and station
     how they remind me of your stem,
     how to engage in talk that drew
     how well he knew the way to hurt --
     how well she'd studied her new role!

     if I show wit in jesting thus.
     if I'd possessed the slightest reason

     if not slow-witted, might have known.
     if you come with me, they'll be flattered;

     in Russian winters thrilled at seeing
     in a melodious, flute-like tone.

     in a still stream that never dries.

     in bed, a young man, stiff and chilled;
     in boxes or the rows of stalls.
     in britzkas, kibítkas and sleighs.
     in casual letters of confession --
     in corners whispering girls concur;
     in country towns and suchlike places
     in dark attire the new-born day.
     in darkest forest depths and drowned
     in darkness in her room, or treated
     in deep anxiety of mind.
     in deepest grasses, quite alone,
     in deepest thought at the chess-board
     in dream toward the woods and plains,
     in dreams and cards and their prediction,
     in due succession; hers is lifted
     in empty deeds and futile toils.

     in first place -- listen, am I right? --
     in flannel, and an old fur cap.
     in flowers of spring it's drinking dry:

     in talk, so fruitless and so stale,
     in tears and violent tossing vented
     in terms of poetry or passion --
     in terms where not a word was spared:

     is it not true that Russian speech,
     is it that she, poor simple sweet,
     is known today; only a soul
     is lost in obstinate reflection;
     is mincing manners -- nothing more.

     is this the riddle's missing clue?
     is this then what you can't forgive?

     it lacked, of course, poetic heart,

     it mastered him in slow gradation;

     it would be painful to depart

     it's hidden deep in gloom and dust.

     its echoes, its belated urging,
     its furrow through the powdery icing;
     its glaring feasts, and shrill events,
     its grip on him, forgot to count
     its image, then to swoon before
     its natural right to rave and flare.
     its newness with our faded days,
     its nullity I've always hated,
     its own perfection everywhere,
     its pristine charm: heeltaps, and leaps,
     its sails go flap-flap as it prances;
     its views, its passions, or its cares!
     its wayward tricks, its violent surging,
     its winds had blown him far off course.
     its work, its torture, its enjoyment,

     like fluff before Aeolian breezes;

     no sound by which her soul is stirred.
     no spark of fun in all its rot!
     no time to pick it up -- she's dying

     no, not for long were belles the ruling

     noise in her ears, glare in her eyes...

     nor turned a poet. In the burst
     nor will my scribbling in such books
     not bad at all; and then each soul
     not cold, but also not effusive,
     not even by chance, once in a while,
     not even in her earliest age;
     not every day could he wash down
     not for the first time he succeeded
     not once a day a thought will quiver,
     not only by Evgeny's eye;
     not only pain, too much to meet...
     not separation's chilling power,
     not the plain, timorous, dejected
     not to see Olga; in a fret
     nothing could alter or could tire
     nothing more lovable than he.
     nothing was barred beyond discussion --
     nothing you did gave cause for blame:
     now I've forgotten all I knew.
     now Lovelace's renown has faded
     now a protruding branch assails her
     now as before, inside my breast;
     now crush with sorrow's dull deployment
     now dazzled by one thing's effulgence,
     now disenchanted with the next,
     now even Didelot's tedious stuff.''
     now free, I once more weave together
     now golden autumn's just arriving.
     now pay attention, I beseech,
     now sensitive, and now carefree,
     now she's bereft, and just the same
     now sweet, his slumbers are distraught.
     now ten has struck, his wheels are rolling,
     now things are changed, now we resemble
     now warmth and blossom are on hand,
     now, by green tablecloths awaited,
     o fields -- to you I'm vowed at heart.

     of absence on my wandering ways!

     of aunts and mothers, and the thrall

     of fate, and life, each in its turn
     of finishing its book, but early
     of five more steps they went, slow-gaited,

     of passion's out, and its whole manner
     of perfect bliss in you. Enough!

     of philosophic isolation,
     of pity for my wretched state,
     of pity: in his silent bow,

     once more Corneille's majestic story;
     once more he can't await the night;

     one sees a duck and aims his gun,
     one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
     one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
     one wallows in delicious weeping;
     only by rule, and strict tradition
     only in January the snow,

     our lives were flat, and what had fired
     our modern Russia's plague and bane.
     our native speech had never sprung
     our terror is their consolation.

     rebuffed, found instant consolation;
     recall, by its bewitching cup,
     recalling earlier loves, did we,
     recalling earlier time's romances,
     red wine in tumblers to the brim --

     roamed the still forest like a ranger,
     roofs, flowerbeds, fences, all in white,
     roses romantically blowing;

     round the dim river sleep; the curtain
     rumours and threats and premonitions,
     runs after what is sweet, and vain.

     same Pom, same husband to the end;
     sang for the guests above the wine;
     saw through the window, morning-bright,
     says the old lady in a croak:
     scarce out of bibs, already fickle,
     scarcely recalled their love, their spite;
     scarlet with passion's instant flaring,
     screened by a hill from storm's intrusion,
     seacoast, to hear in dark of night
     seared as by fire, she stopped. Today
     secluded vales, where swans were crying,
     secret sledge-rides in verse of fire;
     secretly overheard by you.
     secure a secret assignation,
     sed alia tempora! The devil
     see with their jugs the milk-girls go
     self-portraits only -- furthermore
     self-willed it may be just the same;
     send them good wishes through the mail
     sensitive ladies of all ages --
     sent at the Colonel's own behest.
     sent to seduce? Resolve my doubt.
     sentiment, notebook, verses, all

     set off our troubled mind comparing
     set off the ladies like a frame.
     set the guests smiling at his arch,
     set to well-known children's glee:
     sets a sonorous cadence rolling --
     sets out upon her homeward course;
     sets the wise traveller cavorting
     shadows that flit behind the glazing
     shall I see you?'' As Tanya speaks
     shall make my story grim as hell;
     shall my sad gaze no more alight
     shall not attack my lily's root;
     sharing her in promiscuous fashion,
     sharpness of wit, and social art,
     she appears before him, grim and frozen.
     she blossomed in the graceful ways
     she brought her talents, never ceased,
     she burst into a coughing-bout.
     she calls down curses on their leisure,
     she can't escape at any pace --
     she can't make out a single fraction
     she can't; Evgeny's pushed the portal,
     she can't; and in her panic hurry
     she did what nurse advised she do
     she doesn't see, or doesn't mind;
     she drinks it like a priceless potion;
     she fell in love -- the hour was fated...
     she fell in love with all the fancies
     she finds in river and in hill.
     she finds it stifling here... she strains
     she finds, in order alphabetic:
     she flails around, she tries to shout --
     she flies as fast as she can go;
     she flies no more, she's lost her strength.
     she found Evgeny, eyes a-glitter,
     she found, in labours and in leisure,
     she grew accustomed, and contented.
     she guards, in silence and for good,
     she holds a letter up, and leaning
     she lacked her sister's beauty, lacked
     she looks, the room is getting light --
     she lost the language of the gods
     she loved the steppe-land and its singing,
     she lowers darkened eyes, unwitting,
     she never even bit her lip.
     she never joined, or skipped, but rather
     she never read a Russian paper,
     she once had pined in girlish grief,
     she peers discreetly through a chink
     she quite forgot -- began to call
     she roams the empty garden-plot...
     she sang of childhood's fun, indited
     she sat there; through her teeth a word
     she saw no friendly figure starting
     she sees it all. The simple maiden,
     she sighed, and in a trance coopted
     she sits down calmly on one side,
     she sits with head sunk on her breast,
     she speeds her footsteps to a race,
     she spins and, friend of winter nights,
     she stopped at the loud torrent's bound,
     she treads our earth, and how her breast
     she trembles, and with fever drumming
     she visited the humble tents
     she walked across a snowy plain
     she walked, but just as she was turning
     she was unhurried, unobtrusive,
     she went inside the empty shell
     she won't inhale the powdered rime,
     she wrote in French... what a confession!
     she yields to it without condition
     she'd cheer my wordless way, and do
     she'd never join the game selected,
     she'd never tell them news or scandal
     she'll spin this way and that, and beat
     she's nearly swooned, she's suffocating;
     she's their great friend, asked in, caressed,
     she's turned up in my garden, bringing
     she's up and flying through the air
     shelter for trysts at every turning;
     shine out and bring the world to bliss. >2

     shutters are up, and all is pale

     silver with moonlight, in her dreaming
     simple old lady; but the liquor --
     since I stopped sinning years ago.
     since I'm a member of the same.
     since then my heart was wrenched aside;
     since, through the mist that dreams arise on,
     sing God knows whom, compose with art
     sing about something else at last!''
     singing in chorus as directed
     sings as he plaits a humble shoe.

     sits imperturbable, and free.

     sledges, and tardy dawns together
     sleep much, read little, and put down
     sleep runs from her, she turns and turns...
     slumber still floats above his head.
     smile, voice and movements, little waist --
     smiles, and a maiden's tranquil poise,
     smoothe his way out with humour's ointment.
     so Lensky answered the old dear:
     so a storm-shadow wraps away
     so all went smoothly after that.
     so brilliantly he'd hoax the fools,
     so circumspect, and so punctilious,
     so effortlessly can disarm.
     so fires of spring will bring to birth
     so gloriously he'd fool the clever,
     so heartless and so detrimental,
     so it was not in any measure,
     so long as they're employed in song:
     so much, I'm left no time to speak!
     so nearly had them in his power.
     so often from her Moscow cousin
     so pious, and so clever too,
     so pure, so spotless through and through,
     so sketchily possessed by each,
     so that all three went off to lunch,
     so unforgiving a report?
     so virtuous that, no sooner seen,
     so, cursing women's devious course,
     so, full of heart-felt tribulation,
     so, if we want to change, we can!
     so, seeing there no rhyme or reason,
     solemn, too long compelled to throttle
     solitude, stillness and the night,
     some disagreeable remarks.
     some future dunce will point a finger
     some ladies preach from Say and Bentham,
     some minutes long. The words won't fit
     some nonsense thrown up while carousing,
     some other, older spring will gleam,
     some regimental bard has added
     some splendid lady is referring
     some vote a doctor for the case,
     somehow have got the designation
     someone like you and me, just nice?
     someone towards whose heart and mind
     something like spleen, that scourge of Britain,
     something to fritter and to burn,
     something to rack his brains about,
     sometimes from a fair, black-eyed maiden
     sometimes he'd fall into a trap
     sometimes the evening brought together
     sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
     song, laughter, whistle, bark and champ,
     soon a great truth came to enfold her
     soon all that went without a wrench:
     soon, infidelity proved cloying,
     sooner or later will relate

     spirit that anguish had made ill.
     spoke words of hope? But who are you:
     spread out its shadow all around --
     spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,
     spying my features, as he could,

     stiffening as the hours go by,
     still after many years in place.
     still as a shadow, grim and bitter;
     still captivated his young soul.
     still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
     still dim, through crystal's magic glass,
     still eats and drinks enough for two.
     still everywhere the lamps are bright;
     still filled with Eugene, Tanya wrote,
     still hardly opened up, from fading.''
     still has Monsieur Finemouche for friend,
     still made of tulle, the self-same bonnet

     still shivering in the bitter weather

     stood thunder-struck. In what wild round

     straightened his wig, and asked her name.
     stretched on a sofa, calls to greet them.

     struck down as if she'd been accused,
     struck for Evgeny, with its play

     stuff of the poet's hallowed dreams!
     stumblingly call to mind he did
     such careless language of surrender?
     such crystalled scents as best are able
     such frank tendresse; away they stole
     such good and sensible advice;
     such is the usual country cooking;
     such rustic cunning can't be wrong!) --
     such shadowy and leisured ways,
     such stubborn brain, and vivid will,

     surer than friendship or than kin,
     suspecting wonders would come out.

     swapped it for odd tomes of Malvina,
     swaying the artless, waiting on
     sweet as a lover's kiss, and dear,
     sweet old tradition was preserved:
     sweet talk with friends. How many days
     sweet words by which her pain was banned --
     swiftly decayed beyond recall

     take leave of my lightheaded youth!
     take wing on spite; that serious men

     thank him by curtseying to the dust;
     thank you for sorrow and for pleasure,
     thank you for suffering and its joys,
     thank you indeed. Alike in sorrow
     that I prefer to Champagne's tide;
     that I'm just longing to indite --
     that Lensky and Eugene, apart,
     that Menelaus was quite right --
     that alien scene must I now turn
     that all of Russia can't contribute
     that ardent youth entirely lacks;
     that corps of social legislation --
     that could sustain it? Only grimness;
     that even so my wretched style

     that fills him and in which he lives.
     that fired his soul, to burn the same;
     that from the backdoor he'd be leaving
     that generations of new beauties,
     that he's not honest past all question.''
     that huge ballrooms vibrated under,
     that in the usual Christmas scrimmage
     that inexperience leads to grief.''
     that king of the satiric scene,
     that lady the hostess was greeting,
     that lady whose engaging charm
     that languid beauty, listens nicely --
     that lives, and glitters, and endears,
     that marble Nina's proved unable
     that mediocre dress alone
     that modish rings were still a-buying.
     that moment, of a luscious pie
     that night, in secret, set for two;
     that not a syllable be uttered
     that nubile maid of riper age,
     that on the world's staircase there waited
     that once I spent my happiest days?
     that one be shot just anyhow --
     that poison brew; and in your mind
     that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,
     that queen of secrets and of sighing.
     that raves with poetry can ever
     that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,

     that she's so trustful, and imbued
     that somehow that same day we'll meet...
     that soul without a moral tie,
     that spring with me has had its fill
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
     that strikes him with such force and meaning?
     that table where the lamp has languished,
     that there be just one voice which came,
     that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;
     that thievish mouths cannot consume
     that this of all things for a swain
     that verse will turn to useful duties;
     that virgin dream and its confession
     that visitors must be expected.
     that was less clever still by half.
     that we enjoy equating chatter
     that wicked, loose-tongue chatterbox...
     that wit embarrasses the dull;
     that with him to the trysting-place
     that world where every man's a critic
     that your proud glance is sure to take!
     that youthful heart. ``But now at least
     that youthful soul, which pined for sadness;
     that's the morass, I beg you note,
     that's the refrain that you should sing,

     that, artless, and without concealing,
     that, for all this, my shame's report
     that, like proud Byron, I can draw
     that, meanwhile, pinched and glum of feature,
     that, though polite, was clear as ice.
     the Corsair, or the Wandering Jew.
     the Lord have mercy on us all!
     the Major's here: he's all the rage
     the Muses' lofty arts and fashions,
     the Russian N, like N in French;
     the Russian for le comme il faut.
     the abstracted poet would bring forth
     the album of a country miss
     the allée to the lake, the copse;
     the altar flame's extinguished now.
     the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
     the answer's past all human viewing,
     the ardent author of the past
     the art he'd studied best of all,
     the atmosphere of youth and madness,
     the audience still is busy stamping,
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     the bank, the immobile stream are levelled
     the barbs that envy's always spreading,
     the bear -- what next? -- behind her stalked.
     the bear explains: ``my cousin's here --
     the bear has raised her in his paws;
     the bear let out a roar, and held
     the beauties in their flimsy dresses,
     the best revenge one could desire.
     the big room, further, not a cat.
     the blaze of candles, and the trembly
     the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
     the bliss that fills me when your throbbing,
     the blood came smoking from the wound.
     the blood within my withered heart,
     the bloom has withered on the bough;
     the books then underwent inspection...
     the boring wives, the ill-bred men,
     the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
     the branches all are weighted down
     the branches of the oak with flock;
     the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
     the cabinet behind the door
     the carriage of the newly-wed.
     the charge that poets are unable
     the charm of what was grave and plain.
     the child prepares for protocol --
     the children spoilt, the mad, the rogues
     the circumstances of his capture
     the clamorous honking geese began
     the climacteric of our life,
     the clink of rowels, met his hearing;
     the coach has reached its destination;
     the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
     the cold perfection of the sky,
     the cooks prepare the midday meal;
     the coolness of the sombre glade,
     the country cottages and hovels,
     the country's pretty stupid here!
     the crash of plates and knives is blended
     the crown of marriage was projected
     the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
     the cunning prisoner can quite well
     the darling objects -- don't you know it? --
     the darling sex is light as down.
     the days grew shorter, in the glade
     the days that doom has measured out.
     the deeper in the wood, the more
     the doorway opened wide to meet her,
     the downy woods are greener-tinted;
     the draught whose blessings are agreed,
     the driver sits and cuts a dash
     the eager players are enrolled --
     the earlier griefs are what I miss.
     the early pealing of the bells
     the earth for him grew dumb and closed?...
     the easier they become to charm,
     the elegy, grown paralytic,
     the enjoyment of a friendly drink,
     the entire story of your fate.
     the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
     the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
     the faces met with everywhere;
     the fateful diet; by depression
     the fear and rage with which I foam!
     the festal name day has begun.
     the first will never find fruition,
     the flaming roses of a cheek,
     the fleeting tenderness that stole
     the fleeting works of my creation,
     the flickering tones of dress and speech,
     the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
     the flower-like pallor of the maiden,
     the foes, cold-blooded and unspeaking,
     the fools who sparkle far and wide,6
     the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
     the foreign words a maiden's passion
     the friends' salute she never hears
     the frozen corpse, drives off, and homing
     the full fruit of her heart's desire;
     the funeral monument explains:
     the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
     the giddiest hope, carefree and gay,
     the gift of recognizing what
     the girl he'd scorned in what he deemed
     the girl remains there in the gloom
     the girl's attentive eyes are bent.
     the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,
     the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:
     the glare, the fumes in which I live,
     the grand barouche is on its way.
     the grand monde finds it out of place.
     the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;
     the guardian angel of tradition,
     the guests are feasted, good and hearty,
     the guests squeeze closer to the centres;
     the hall's without a living creature,
     the hapless Phrygians all the same,
     the happenings of the previous night;
     the hare who from afar has seen
     the hat, the scowling brow, the chest
     the headpiece-text is thus indited --
     the heart and all its fragile dreams.
     the heart inside him seemed to shrink;
     the heart of the professional flirt!
     the heartache that they bring lies deep.
     the heavenly lights in glorious quire
     the herdsman's horn proclaimed the morning
     the hero's name's decided too.
     the highest circles are a bore.
     the homely scene, take pleasure in it --
     the horns, and the moustachio'd nozzles --
     the horrid nightmare must portend
     the horror of disgrace and crime,
     the horse gets wind of them and, snorting,
     the horses fidget worse and worse;
     the hostess cries and, moving fast,
     the hour was late. And now from aching
     the household boys in noisy rout;
     the hunter in the wood will swear
     the idol that she'll most admire
     the impatient conqueror was humbled!
     the imperturbable princess.
     the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
     the inevitable silly asses,
     the infant year with cheerful greeting:
     the inmost thoughts that girls can hide.
     the iron figure3 on the table,
     the jagged flint's pulled back anew.
     the jams appear in little dishes;
     the joys of youth, that festal cup,
     the jug of bilberry wine is seen.1
     the keys that opened up the hall.
     the kiss where youth and freshness gleam;
     the ladies' calculated dress;
     the latest fashions of the town;
     the laurel in the old man's crown!
     the leather rein, to learn the tale,
     the legatee of his relations --
     the letter from Tatyana's hand:
     the letter trembles in her grip;
     the level tenor of his going,
     the lies that in the press run rife,
     the linen stretched on the tambour.
     the logs; the wild ones have the floor;
     the lover of Julie Wolmar,3
     the lucky bard, and as he dozed
     the lust for blood drew them apart?
     the magic voices of your stream,
     the maidens all are slumbering deep.
     the man of honour and of sense.
     the man of reverie and reflection,
     the man she feared and idolized --
     the man who laid her brother low.
     the marriage plans were all exact
     the matchwood chatters as it lights.
     the meaning of an epigraph,
     the men confront them, face to face:
     the merchant's up, the cabman's walking
     the millions of two-legged creation
     the moderns rage against the old.
     the modesty of her condition,
     the modish Record Office clerks
     the moon in its azure of air.
     the moon; but in the darkened glass
     the morning after, a surprise
     the morning light no longer lingers,
     the mountain maiden,19 my ideal,
     the murmur where the streamlet played...
     the murmuring Nereids recite,
     the needle, never had she lingered
     the neighbour... you must tell the brat
     the new ballet he should be at.
     the new moon, horned, on her left side,
     the nightingale's begun to sing.
     the nightly luminaries climb.
     the noise their rustic wheels projected --
     the occupations of the morning.
     the odious bear still grunts and lumbers.
     the old dame wept her daughter's parting,
     the one who killed the youthful poet?''
     the only face to shake and pass
     the other, jugs of applejack,
     the pages of some dull review,
     the pain, the grief, the marrow-freezing
     the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
     the party waits. Seized with an illness
     the peaceful Muses' devotee,
     the pensive Dryads' hiding-ground.
     the pillars of the turnpike-gate;
     the poet struck down by his friend!
     the poet's heart found full expression,
     the poet's only theme is ``I.''
     the potholes make the coach unsteady.
     the prejudices of the ages,
     the prince bring up his own relation
     the prince looks at him, and replies:
     the programme of his daily round.
     the quintessential reaction
     the regimental band is coming,
     the ring of marriageable girls --
     the rogue has got a finger frozen:
     the rosy bloom that glowed so newly
     the rosy sealing-wafer's drying
     the roundest face that you've set eyes on,
     the sad beginnings of his life
     the safest place for declarations,
     the same as any other day.
     the samovar of evening boiled,
     the season which is such a bore --
     the secret of her husband's measure,
     the secrets of the grave, the pages
     the shades of night within their keeping
     the shady wood, the talking stream;
     the shepherd sings of Volga's fishing
     the shepherd, as he used to do,
     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     the simple faith of olden days
     the simple legend -- then a haze
     the sky is brilliant in its blue
     the skyblue eyes, the flaxen tresses,
     the snow from all surrounding hills;
     the sober head, detesting each
     the solitude of woods and tillage,
     the source's chattering voice is heard;
     the spring invites you to the land
     the spring of honour, and the pin
     the stars, the moon -- celestial light
     the strain of Tasso's octave-rhyme!
     the strangeness of her habitation,
     the strophe over which I slaved;
     the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
     the sufferings of tempestuous passion;
     the sumptuous palais shines out;
     the swarm, the glittering mob that presses,
     the talk of guests when they appear;
     the tears in stream pour down her cheeks.
     the third day, wood and hill and grazing
     the thirst for work, the lust for learning,
     the thought of volatile renown.
     the thought sank in, and penetrated:
     the thoughts of my two anchorites.
     the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,
     the tighter we can stretch above them
     the time to go has long since passed
     the tolerant Evgeny heard --
     the toll of those borne off by fate!
     the tongue of love and of Petrarch.
     the total ownership of woods,
     the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming
     the trail the youthful poet followed
     the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,
     the two foes stand with eyes downcast.
     the uncertainties within his heart;
     the units are ourselves alone.
     the universe is all perfection;
     the unmetric verses of tradition
     the untiring city, where you've given
     the unworthy husband through depressing
     the urn of perfumed tea, and tipping
     the usurers' voracious tribe.
     the utter virtue of their being,
     the vales dry out, grow brightly printed;
     the valley's dark. The forest lands
     the vital force gives them the shoot
     the war, the snowfall, and his wife.
     the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,
     the wild rose blooms, and in the covert
     the wilful fancies of the heart.
     the wine-addict adores the cup:
     the winter's ways are smooth as glass.
     the world and all its works, she wept
     the world's éclat, its thunder-roll,
     the year, his age, then: ``may your rest,
     the young hostess, towards whom each
     the youth of those past days in line
     the youthful lover once again
     the youthful votary of rhyme
     their breed would (some years after this)
     their cloaks; Zaretsky's measured off
     their guests, for all they ate and drank,
     their hand to grapple slander's cup,
     their hands are dipped in scarlet gore,
     their hopes, their pranks, their dreams at night --
     their journey took them a full week.
     their joyous way across the ice;
     their looks and language in deceit
     their lords, and thwack their palms together;
     their masters' berries undetected
     their southward flight: one saw approaching
     their table, and their hours of leisure?
     their tendency to call, and sit.
     their unattractive tête-à-tête;
     themes popular or idealistic,
     then I'd have looked for you alone
     then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
     then afterwards, alone, at ease,
     then dress...
     then from his cabinet he'll pass
     then from the Muse there came revival:
     then he began to talk once more
     then he presents her with the scroll.
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     then in the study's quiet setting,
     then know that your reproving finger,
     then later slyly he'd revile them
     then liking grew, then every day
     then night comes on; the moon's patrolling
     then on the leaves of recollection,
     then quickly something changed all this:
     then quietly at last says she:
     then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...
     then suddenly she's off, and there
     then to the altar, to be crowned.
     then, country evening fast arriving,
     then, help me God, she caterwauls:
     then, on the last page, the suggestion:
     then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
     there сzerov8 shared the unwilling
     there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
     there any friend of harmless pleasure
     there caustic Shakhovskóy8 came in
     there gathered at the coffin-side
     there never fails a kindly greeting,
     there waited for us both the malice
     there was a general furtive chatter,
     there was a softness in his glance:
     there was no trace to be detected
     there'll be a fight. For that I give
     there's a small window shining in it,
     there's crashing, rumbling, pounding, trotting,
     there's far too much of contradiction,
     there's no absurdity as such,
     there's no ignoble tale that seems
     there's not a word she's understood;
     there's nothing can employ her anguish,
     there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
     there, where the coulisse entrance went,
     these words are not of Russian stock:
     they all have richly earned a pension;''
     they all have swarmed into the hall,
     they all still keep their old impress:
     they buried Uncle, congregated
     they don't deserve what they inspire
     they find her somewhat unexpected,
     they fluff her curls out in the fashion,
     they heap up silver with a spade;
     they kill the zest of rhymed composing,
     they leave their shores and fly away.
     they managed to disperse the pack.
     they met on horseback; quickly they
     they needed kvas like air; at table
     they nudged Tatyana, and each muttered
     they praise the Father of the world.
     they rise and ripen and fall dead:
     they shared their days in deed and heart,
     they shove each plate, and every chair,
     they sit, they cross themselves for grace.
     they talk of her, of how and whether:
     they took offence at this, and broke
     they were her only food... and so
     they while away the morning's calm.
     they'd just enrage it with their dart.
     they'd settled that some years before.
     they're all chained up in different fetters,
     they're on the dance-floor, waltzing, spinning.
     they're plunging, whirling, all but squatting.
     they've moved around and been reseated;
     thickly the exclamations fly.
     thinking: he loved me, and in strife
     thirty-two steps with great precision,
     this Grandison of hers was splendid,
     this angel, this proud devil, tell,
     this child of luxury and delight.
     this denizen of the coulisses
     this modish whirl, this social story,
     this soul that glowed with virgin fire.
     this very day I'd gladly give,
     this was our heroes' conversation
     this was the science of that passion
     those monkeys of the good old days:
     those walks amid the gloom and calm
     those words where love, without condition,
     though I'll come back to him, yet clearly
     though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
     though cold I am and sad; in sleep
     though he's unknown, there's no suggestion
     though some support it with good grace).
     though there he's no more to be found,
     though we... don't shine in any way,
     though what's romantic here I simply
     though years ago I used to look
     thought them a pointless peccadillo;
     thought, day and night, and thought again
     thoughts of a girl, or as the moon
     threats, vows, and simulated fears,
     three carts -- traditional procession --
     three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
     threw Eugene at her feet -- she stirred,
     thrives to this moment, in a station
     through baseness of the soul that he,
     through distant regions of the heart...
     through gloom and mist; and there came streaming
     through heaven's expanse serenely flying,
     through him is sweetness' self. In grumbling
     through it they're known to me, and kin.
     through the back porch runs out and flies
     throughout the boredom of the hours --
     throw meadows into muddy rout,
     thumps as the balls are pressed inside
     till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
     till he at last was summoned down
     till now our language -- proud, God knows --
     till then had been dispersed and wasted --
     time was when morning's breeze was swaying
     time was, in evening hours of leisure,
     times were when I was sharp and bold:
     times were, when master's least suggestion...''
     to Aÿ's vintage in the sequel
     to Eugene all was new and thrilling;
     to Eugene's letter, word for word.
     to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
     to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...
     to Moscow settled in a trice.
     to Olga's face, he whispered low
     to Tanya, all's an empty show.
     to a soirée. ``My God! to her!...
     to aim, at steady, even pace
     to all that's trivial and inane?
     to all the most adored actrices,
     to all this tattle, yet at heart
     to ask of you that you transcend
     to battle further with my passion;
     to be respected all through life:
     to be the bride I'd call my own.
     to bee and butterfly unknown.
     to bellow out: ``she's mine, she's mine.''
     to blow his brains out, but in stead
     to boom, to flash across the sky,
     to bring across Lepage's4 mortal
     to burn -- and then by force of reason
     to captivate, and then to fly.
     to catch the eye and to attract.
     to clasp your knees, and at your feet
     to come back to the hall alone
     to comfort her in all her woes,
     to cool my glances and my tongue,
     to crack between them; for a while
     to demonstrate some signs of reason:
     to do them all is easy game.
     to drain its beaker down, nor thought
     to drain, on credit, bottles three.
     to draw a breath, around her staring
     to dreaming given up unduly,
     to drive the swooning senses mad;
     to drop all that old-fashioned mumming;
     to drown the hiss of modish wives.
     to each and every raving feast
     to eat and drink, then separated
     to encase herself inside a layer
     to ensure that till next time our image
     to expose to Moscow fops and Circes
     to face him now I feel too frail...
     to fashion's absolute dictate,
     to feasts and fun this winter past;
     to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
     to fresh grandparents every day.
     to garden walks, as arm in arm
     to gasp, and on a bench to sink.
     to gentlemen on every side
     to give you honest explanation.
     to happen long ago, dear readers,
     to hear him howl: ``that's me!'' You'll get
     to hear what latest modes require,
     to heart. And in his misted gaze
     to help her from the other side;
     to her flower-garden, to her novels, --
     to her glass porch; pursues her round
     to hide a hope, to make a show
     to high renown my doleful story,
     to his Tatyana, yes, he's racing,
     to his disputing and his cursing;
     to his mysterious tree the snake
     to hit the target: thigh or brain.
     to hope that even once a week
     to horror-stories told at night
     to infuriate a clumsy foe;
     to institute a new regime.
     to it the people's blessing never
     to kiss Armida's lips, or seek
     to kissing or caressing father
     to know the audience hears his voice.
     to know you, swooned, and in a second
     to lie down at her feet like slaves!
     to life and hope with just a glance --
     to life grew colder than the dead.
     to lift her skirt up; still she's flying,
     to lift his pistol up. A span
     to liven with a silk atour
     to look like sad romanticism.
     to me her best in-quarto tome,
     to me so simply, with the fires
     to meet a black monk, or if crossing
     to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,
     to meet the unhappy poet, skipped
     to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
     to my young days, it's time I turned
     to nobody except a wizened
     to pass for an affected freak,
     to pass for cultured in our ranks.
     to pass the evening. No? then tot
     to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
     to pine away from passion's thirst,
     to play with a dishevelled tress,
     to pranks and jokes of earlier date.
     to put on chains for him, and steady
     to puzzle out with some precision
     to rains, and flax, and the stockyard.''
     to raise the safety catch and strain
     to reasoned talk, no dull hearsay,
     to roar of banquets, din of brawling,
     to save the honour of our land
     to scorn the men with whom he deals;
     to see life as a ritual play,
     to see my kin, and in the end
     to see the grave, and shed a tear.
     to see you, faithfully to follow,
     to sing of others must imply
     to sleep some black and empty dreams;
     to smother her dear feet with kissing.
     to sob out prayer, complaint, confession,
     to speak; believe me: of my shame
     to spoil loose paper by the ream;
     to steal away her neighbour's light
     to stem the bloodstream's wild outburst;
     to tales that young moustachios tell.
     to talk as if with heart unwrung,
     to talk of this and that, but then
     to talk to her, but language died.

     to the beginning of our days.
     to the circle of our dance.
     to the complacent and the null;
     to the empty homestead made her way,
     to the first meanings of his flute.
     to the hero that she'd adopted.
     to the princess, in his weak hand,
     to undertake their resurrection,
     to us, though, not exactly new.
     to vice, while virtue got its crown.
     to wave farewell the household waits
     to where he came to her that time
     to which so oft we've dedicated
     to whisper it her inmost prayer.
     to whom your hearts are dedicated,
     to whom, in a fine flow of preaching,
     to wiser words and deeds, and learned
     to wreak, by stirring Lensky's ire,
     to wreck a maiden's sleep with fable,
     to your loved ones? They do maintain
     together they arrived, and none

     too long he's hoaxed us high and low...''
     too long, against my inclination,
     too pale, too thin, but on the whole

     torment of pride? And why's he come?
     touches her hand, or throws a fur
     touches obliquely, but with speed,
     toward the neighbouring valley's river.
     towards his stall, the pedlar's hawking;
     towards the Larins' and arriving
     towards the simple urn beneath;
     tracked him, and put him in duress,
     tradition still keeps my respect.

     tumbled and whirled and twisted quaintly
     twin lamps of serried coupés throw
     twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
     two cupboards, one divan, a table,
     two hearts, a torch, and a nosegay;
     two or three novels where our later
     two pines have tangled at the root;
     two poles that ice had glued like plaster
     two sisters who'd received the initial,9
     two verses of the Aeneid.
     unanimous exchange of looks
     unconsciously he let it mount
     under the table's linen shield,
     undressed, by candlelight selected
     unfathomable to the mind;
     unhesitating from her tongue,
     unloved, and friendless, and estranged.
     unnoticed, in unseeing style,
     unseen, already you were dear,
     unspeaking, too, but stretched out there
     unswerving friend, correct landowner,
     until Bréguet's unsleeping chime
     until the dawn beneath her pillow.
     until the grave by your strong hand:
     until the tombstone; there one day
     until this day, a lady's love
     untirable, at sound of drum:
     untouched by envy's bitter smarting,
     untouched by trace of inhibition,
     up the hillside at breakneck pace;
     up your accounts, and raging, toping,
     upon her feverish tongue; the slip
     upon her lips the breathing dies,
     upon it, and with head down-bent
     upon the side of the distaff --
     urbane betrayals, and the chilling
     use cunning silence as a screen,
     used in times past to ring a peal
     using overt or covert rules.

     vexation? vainness? heavens above,
     villages flickered far and near,

     wakened at the same hour of night
     walked homeward round the kitchen garden;
     wanders in a distracted way
     was Göttingen, his alma mater,
     was an enchanting country nook:
     was asked around as quite a catch --
     was brought there by a huckster who
     was by forebodings much oppressed.
     was far from happy with his role.
     was finding leisure's vacuum cruel;
     was his absorption in their sense.
     was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
     was it not you, dear apparition,
     was just created for the part.
     was one who raged and raged again,
     was quite beyond his wit, we found.
     was still mysterious and enticing --
     was stripped away, and mists encroaching
     was that calm brow of one who swooned.
     was the first thing that Olga said.
     was the sad poet not confounded
     was undiscovered to that day.
     was younger still, but at that stage
     watch for your smile, and catch your gaze
     watch the games we maidens play.''
     watched sun and clock -- then by such labours
     we have to cherish and admire
     we sometimes like to hear again
     we visit them, or without fail
     we weep for the young lover's end,
     we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
     we'd better hasten to the ball,
     we'll draw it deeper in our net;
     we'll go with her to that delicious
     we'll keep love's price appreciating,
     we'll talk, and talk, and then we'll show

     were you in love when you were young?''
     what London calls, with humble duty
     what came from this unlooked-for meeting;
     what can one do? as said above,
     what dream accounts for her distraction?
     what feelings would assume control
     what flowers of spring display your dint?
     what have your wits to do with me?
     what held me was my predilection,
     what holds her in profound reflection,
     what is he? Just an apparition,
     what it's transported to our shore
     what kind of thought, what observation,
     what moves along the hidden ways
     what occupied his chafing powers
     what odes Vladimir might have written --
     what play will he present this week?
     what store of riches it imparts!
     what traps he'd set him, with what malice
     what was it in your heart it found
     what wings our first successes gave!
     what's in them? All this loud parading,
     what's more, I loved you; but my hunger,
     whatever you may need, just call...
     when Bréguet's chime is heard proclaiming
     when galloping at headlong pace
     when he arrived; not in the slightest:
     when hourly we ourselves betrayed it,
     when in the park, in the allée
     when little notes come on a tray.
     when night patrol's a perilous calling;
     when not quite eighteen years of age.
     when our Zaretsky met his eyes.
     when our sublimest aspiration,
     when shall I start on my escape?
     when suddenly I saw this treasure
     when we begin to talk of verse);
     when we see him from afar,
     when, from behind the doorway, hidden
     when, in pale sky, the stars' procession
     when, on the plain, green herbs are massed,
     when, utterly worn out by rhyming,
     where (standard rhyme) are youth and fleetness?
     where Tanya now confronts Eugene.
     where a sharp nail has made a dent.
     where admonitions are pronounced,
     where are distress, commiseration?
     where are the reveries this time,
     where civil treacheries are rife,
     where did that glum eccentric go,
     where dwelt this child of inspiration,
     where every day a bloodstained shade
     where fate had fixed our confrontation,
     where flows a little glittering brook,
     where folded arms are tightly pressed.
     where he was master of his college,
     where her security's complete.
     where in the heart of silence rang
     where nowadays I'm soundly trounced,
     where scribbling friends have interjected
     where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
     where the prize-boy of fashion's college
     where two old pinetrees stand united:
     where you were born as well, I think,
     where's the high aim, the ardent sense
     where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
     whether from heaven or from hell,
     whether it goes careering past,
     which I myself won't praise or blame
     which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
     which has recalled, without precision,
     which held him silently subjected,
     which smilingly your friend, supported
     which with a blush he leaves unread.
     which, listening with some condescension,
     while Petersburg's already rousing,
     while a mazurka holds the crowd;
     while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:
     while floors would split from crash of heel,
     while in the hut a girl is singing;
     while men, all sombre, all the same,
     while odes have high and noble aims...''
     while roar of violins contrives
     while serious topics were disputing,
     while she's from top to toe surveyed;
     while, marmot-like, he hibernated --
     whisper of breeze announces morning,
     whisper repeated to the crone.
     whispered by heart a note addressed
     whispers some ballad of the hour,
     whither does all my yearning tend?
     who all his life would garner praise
     who can combine it with the free
     who early died as die the brave'' --
     who else? -- the hero of our novel!
     who in the country spends her summer,
     who in the dark came flashing through
     who late at night are whirled away
     who never learnt how dreamers babble;
     who never scorned the social rabble;
     who on a deuce, that famous cheat,
     who sets me snoring then and there --
     who swaggers in with the reply.
     who walks with sorrow, and with danger,
     who was it that you dreamt about?''
     who'd sit, and at the end of play
     who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
     who, in good time, would calmly get
     whoever you may be, a friend,
     whom shall we never find a bore?
     whom thirty centuries have adored!
     whose heart experience has cooled
     whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive,
     whose kindly hand will ruffle down
     whose memory will preserve for me
     whose serfs are miserably thin;
     why fight what's known to be decisive?
     why, at the thought, my husband's mother
     wild as a forest deer, and fearful,
     will anger you in its confession.
     will blossom into splendid highways:
     will disappear as fast as smoke:
     will find the ice elude his grip
     will give you a complete reply.
     will halt her horse and, gripping tightly
     will in a flash decide his lot.
     will in my soul be hushed and dying.
     will loyally discharge its duties,
     will reach, and past the tomb's compound
     will the benighted reason smile,
     wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;
     wished him to come and say farewell.
     wishes his madness to the devil,
     with Eugene frozen where he stood.
     with Eugene proved a tempting prize.
     with Guillot; while pourparlers last
     with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
     with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
     with Tolstoy's2 brush, or decorated
     with a Venetian maiden who
     with a blunt cue for the duration,
     with a consumption, they've relied.
     with a first click, the catch is tried.
     with a quick look perusing lightly
     with a small tray and a teacup.
     with all our hearts, and who require
     with amber pipes from Tsaregrad;12
     with an avowal just as artless;
     with an obeisance I'll hand over...
     with any torture so exquisite
     with balm of prayer my torn and rended
     with bended knees a windmill dances,
     with brilliant conquests by the shower,
     with broods of children of all ages,
     with bursts of passion from the heart,
     with care Zaretsky stows away
     with careful schemes of decoration
     with cause that I've recalled them here.
     with censure -- I've done all to earn it!
     with charming forefinger she traced
     with combs, and steel utensils serving
     with comedies of swarm and din;
     with cranium aching fit to split;
     with custom, love would fade away;
     with deeds; that dunces now and then
     with deep emotion looks about
     with deep emotion through and through,
     with demoiselles of riper age;
     with draughts from love's enticing flask,
     with each nuance of wintry glow:
     with every different kind of rabble...''
     with every sort of home possession:
     with eyes aflame Onegin rises
     with eyes of love, with greed to swallow
     with fire from every cross of gold.
     with fond caress? whose adoration
     with foppery and too much starch,
     with fright, she hears the approaching bear;
     with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,
     with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
     with heart that's grown unused to praise,
     with her own forests and her meads...
     with his forefathers would seem better;
     with irresistible refulgence,
     with jealousy beyond all measure
     with lampions studded all about
     with lies and jokes that packed a punch:
     with lines to mark where they were sleeping...
     with lively and pellucid look,
     with love and comfort in your meaning,
     with me to see an alien strand;
     with mournful sound the secret shade
     with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
     with old Anisia. The next day
     with our Mamas, and a sensation
     with our poor girl was kind and good;
     with parks and mansions, open up.
     with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
     with perturbation and with worry;
     with pleasure on his vengeful act.
     with pots and basins out of mind,
     with puzzled and confused regard...
     with recent fortune, vainly waited
     with sabre's slash, and bullet's blast.
     with scorn to make my world a hell.
     with sheer enchantment fills her cup!
     with shelves of books deployed for action,
     with sighs unconsciously regretful.
     with spinning noise and senseless flashing
     with storm and tumult in his head,
     with such a blissful, brief infection --
     with tears, in quarters of the maids:
     with tenderness he'd watched and noted
     with the grand general in her wake --
     with the pink glow the snows assume
     with the resounding chime of glass.
     with the unmistakeable sideview
     with this the hero of my tale:
     with thoughts of him in ceaseless round.
     with three roan horses in a line
     with trees decked in their silvery kit,
     with tufts of snow; and through the lifted
     with visions of enchanted night,
     with whom your thoughts are so obsessed --
     with work at home; but when he'd gone,
     with years no more to meet our gaze?
     with young Semyónova,9 and there
     with your good offices, and so
     within her bosom to abate,
     without a goal on which to fix,
     without a trace of spite or plot,
     without a word Tatyana leant
     without an elegiac frill,
     without preliminary feeler
     without surprise or rage... his laden,
     won't benefit these guts of mine.''
     won't even cross their minds by stealth...
     word on his lips, and thought: it's sheer
     words mispronounced, thoughts ill-expressed
     works where contemporary man
     worthier of you in the perfection
     would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might
     would be allied to him by fate;
     would bless the form his fortune took.
     would cause widespread remark and tattle,
     would fill Tatyana from afar
     would have been all that we required!
     would have been spared this laceration.
     would have divined the tender, shrinking
     would launch into self-sacrifice;
     would leave her dithering and tossing.
     would not have recognized again
     would on those evenings guess the fate
     would say goodbye and drive away,
     would settle, on the morrow morning,
     would talk, keep silent, laugh, then frown --
     wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!
     wronged always in disgraceful fashion --
     years back, to call up many a fable;
     yes, even there its triumph grows.
     yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
     yes, in that spring-time, in low-lying
     yes, these were our forefathers' ways,
     yet a capricious inclination,
     yet dared not trust what I could see.
     yet floods of talk around the town...
     yet he fell out of love at last
     yet he'd back you through thick and thin:
     yet how I wish that I might raise
     yet people's malice and suspicion
     yet, as each rule has its exception,
     yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
     you acted well, that dread occasion,
     you age, and life's just grief and sadness...''
     you called there twice, and since then took
     you drink the magic draught of yearning,
     you find the country godforsaken;
     you gave me such a shocking fright!
     you help him to an honoured fate
     you in my arms on gingerbread?''
     you kept your friendship with our friend:
     you know I'm hard to comprehend...
     you learn life's sweetness, and with this
     you left no steps that could be tracked:
     you loved the opulent contact
     you made me drunk as one could ask!
     you newborn work, and like a winner
     you object of my guileless ditties!
     you see the two in uniform...
     you see your fated tempter stand.
     you see, with tears and incantation
     you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
     you too have seen on Neva's brink.
     you took an honourable part --
     you were the first ones he forswore;
     you won't find that quite so much catch...
     you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
     you'd not so much as know the name,
     you'll never leave me to my fate.
     you'll read: here's Pradt,7 here's Walter Scott!
     you'll recognize him soon enough, --
     you're all in fever... heavens above.''
     you're really going? Well, I'm sad.
     you're sure to find her portrait in it:
     you've made so many secret rhymes,
     you've paid insanity its due.
     young Tanya first appeared to me,
     young poet, be for ever blest!''
     young traitresses by the platoon,
     your Tanya's image in your mind,
     your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
     your advent swamps me in its flood!
     your battles, lawless and atrocious,
     your chorus, is it dead for ever?
     your cold discourse, were less unkind --
     your dashing one, is she surviving?''
     your early life, unlock your tongue:
     your feet, to pale and waste... what rapture!
     your grief would fail to touch my heart,
     your heart some self-restraint; for each
     your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >
     your heroes, raging and ferocious,
     your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
     your loved one, honourable reader!
     your matchlessness, to seek to capture
     your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
     your night of fretting's left no trace!
     your presence aches, and in my blood!
     your pride, some answer, or in truth
     your soul displays, in holy dreams,
     your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
     your words, and in my soul to explore
     yourself too long from social life.''
     youth is a fever; we must spare
     youth which has nothing to regret,
     youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
     youthful, who ripened in his time,
